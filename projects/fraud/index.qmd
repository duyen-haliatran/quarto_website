In this project, we developed a comprehensive fraud detection model using a methodical approach
outlined in five primary stages: data preparation, feature engineering, feature selection, model
evaluation and implementation. The culmination of this project in the deployment of an
XGBoost-based fraud detection model represents a significant step forward in safeguarding our
operations against fraudulent activities. The modelâ€™s performance, evidenced by substantial
potential savings and a strategic 5% cutoff point, highlights its effectiveness in identifying
high-risk transactions with precision.

Model Methodology:

- Baseline Logistic Model
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- LBGM
- Catboost
- Neural Network
- XGB
