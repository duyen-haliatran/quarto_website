Do each as a t-test and separately as a linear regression, and confirm you get the exact same results from both methods. When doing a t-test, use the formula in the class slides. When doing the linear regression, regress for example mrm2 on treatment and look at the estimated coefficient on the treatment variable. It might be helpful to compare parts of your analysis to Table 1 in the paper. Be sure to comment on your results (hint: why is Table 1 included in the paper)."

    "text": "Experimental Results\n\nCharitable Contribution Made\nFirst, I analyze whether matched donations lead to an increased response rate of making a donation.\ntodo: make a barplot with two bars. Each bar is the proportion of people who donated. One bar for treatment and one bar for control.\ntodo: run a t-test between the treatment and control groups on the binary outcome of whether any charitable donation was made. Also run a bivariate linear regression that demonstrates the same finding. (It may help to confirm your calculations match Table 2a Panel A.) Report your statistical results and interpret them in the context of the experiment (e.g., if you found a difference with a small p-value or that was statistically significant at some threshold, what have you learned about human behavior? Use mostly English words, not numbers or stats, to explain your finding.)\ntodo: run a probit regression where the outcome variable is whether any charitable donation was made and the explanatory variable is assignment to treatment or control. Confirm that your results replicate Table 3 column 1 in the paper.\n\n\nDifferences between Match Rates\nNext, I assess the effectiveness of different sizes of matched donations on the response rate.\ntodo: Use a series of t-tests to test whether the size of the match ratio has an effect on whether people donate or not. For example, does the 2:1 match rate lead increase the likelihood that someone donates as compared to the 1:1 match rate? Do your results support the ‚Äúfigures suggest‚Äù comment the authors make on page 8?\ntodo: Assess the same issue using a regression. Specifically, create the variable ratio1 then regress gave on ratio1, ratio2, and ratio3 (or alternatively, regress gave on the categorical variable ratio). Interpret the coefficients and their statistical precision.\ntodo: Calculate the response rate difference between the 1:1 and 2:1 match ratios and the 2:1 and 3:1 ratios. Do this directly from the data, and do it by computing the differences in the fitted coefficients of the previous regression. what do you conclude regarding the effectiveness of different sizes of matched donations?\n\n\nSize of Charitable Contribution\nIn this subsection, I analyze the effect of the size of matched donation on the size of the charitable contribution.\ntodo: Calculate a t-test or run a bivariate linear regression of the donation amount on the treatment status. What do we learn from doing this analysis?\ntodo: now limit the data to just people who made a donation and repeat the previous analysis. This regression allows you to analyze how much respondents donate conditional on donating some positive amount. Interpret the regression coefficients ‚Äì what did we learn? Does the treatment coefficient have a causal interpretation?\ntodo: Make two plot: one for the treatment group and one for the control. Each plot should be a histogram of the donation amounts only among people who donated. Add a red vertical bar or some other annotation to indicate the sample average for each plot."

    "text": "Simulation Experiment\nAs a reminder of how the t-statistic ‚Äúworks,‚Äù in this section I use simulation to demonstrate the Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem.\nSuppose the true distribution of respondents who do not get a charitable donation match is Bernoulli with probability p=0.018 that a donation is made.\nFurther suppose that the true distribution of respondents who do get a charitable donation match of any size is Bernoulli with probability p=0.022 that a donation is made.\n\nLaw of Large Numbers\nto do: Make a plot like those on slide 43 from our first class and explain the plot to the reader. To do this, you will simulate 100,00 draws from the control distribution and 10,000 draws from the treatment distribution. You‚Äôll then calculate a vector of 10,000 differences, and then you‚Äôll plot the cumulative average of that vector of differences. Comment on whether the cumulative average approaches the true difference in means.\n\n\nCentral Limit Theorem\nto do: Make 4 histograms like those on slide 44 from our first class at sample sizes 50, 200, 500, and 1000 and explain these plots to the reader. To do this for a sample size of e.g.¬†50, take 50 draws from each of the control and treatment distributions, and calculate the average difference between those draws. Then repeat that process 999 more times so that you have 1000 averages. Plot the histogram of those averages. Comment on whether zero is in the ‚Äúmiddle‚Äù of the distribution or whether it‚Äôs in the ‚Äútail.‚Äù"

This insight into human behavior suggests that the strategy employed to encourage donations in the treatment group was effective in increasing donation rates.\nIn other words, if the experiment involved sending out letters asking for donations, and the treatment group received letters with a special message or offer not given to the control group, we could interpret these results to mean that the special message or offer motivated more people to donate.

It suggests that the actual ratio, rather than the ease of achieving a match, motivates donors\nContradiction of the statement: The significant effects effects observed at higher match ratios contradict any implication the match ratios do not influence donor behavior. It shows that higher ratios can indeed motivate more donations\n\n\n\n\nRegression on ratio1, ratio2, ratio3\nFirst of all, create a new ratio1 variable\n\n\nCode\ndata['ratio1'] = rsm.ifelse(data.ratio == 1, 1, 0)\n\n\n\nLinear regression\n\n\nCode\nlr = rsm.model.regress(\n    data = data,\n    rvar = 'gave',\n    evar = ['ratio1', 'ratio2', 'ratio3']\n)\nlr.coef.round(3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nindex\ncoefficient\nstd.error\nt.value\np.value\n\n\n\n\n\n0\nIntercept\n0.018\n0.001\n16.225\n0.000\n***\n\n\n1\nratio1\n0.003\n0.002\n1.661\n0.097\n.\n\n\n2\nratio2\n0.005\n0.002\n2.744\n0.006\n**\n\n\n3\nratio3\n0.005\n0.002\n2.802\n0.005\n**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe linear regression results are as follows:\nratio1 represent 1:1 matching:\n\nCoefficient: 0.003: suggesting that ratio increases the probability of making a donation by 0.3% points\np_value = 0.097\n\nAt the 95% confidence level, the coefficient for 1:1 match ratio is not statistically significant because p_value is greater than 0.05, which means we are less confident that 1:1 match ratio has a real effect on the donation probability in the population\nratio2 represent 2:1 matching:\n\nCoefficient: 0.005, indicates a 0.5% point increase in the probability of making a donation\nP-value: 0.006\n\nThe coefficient for the 2:1 match ratio is statistically significant at the 95% confidence level, as the p-value is well below 0.05, which means we can quite confident that the 2:1 match ratio has a positive effect on the probability of donating\nratio3 represent 3:1 matching:\n\nCoefficient: 0.005, also indicates a 0.5% point increase in the probability of making a donation\nP-value: 0.005\n\nSimilarly, the coefficient for the 3:1 match ratio is statistically significant at the 95% confidence level.\nStatistical Precision\nThe ‚Äòstd.error‚Äô column shows the standard error of each coefficient, which is a measure of the precision of the coefficient estimate. Smaller standard errors indicate more precise estimates. In this table, the standard errors for the treatment levels are the same (0.002), suggesting similar levels of precision across these estimates.\nThe results indicate that only the 2:1 and 3:1 match ratios significantly increase the likelihood of donations compared to the control group at the 95% confidence level. The effects of these higher match ratios are robust, suggesting that they are effective strategies for increasing donation rates.\nThe 1:1 match ratio, while showing a positive effect, does not reach the threshold for statistical significance at this confidence level. This implies that while there might be a slight increase in donation likelihood with a 1:1 match, the evidence is not strong enough to conclusively state this at the 95% confidence level.\n\n\nResponse rate difference\n\n\nCode\nrr_1_1 = data[data['ratio1'] == 1]['gave'].mean()\nrr_2_1 = data[data['ratio2'] == 1]['gave'].mean()\nrr_3_1 = data[data['ratio3'] == 1]['gave'].mean()\n\nrr_diff_11_vs_21 = rr_2_1 - rr_1_1\nrr_diff_21_vs_31 = rr_3_1 - rr_2_1\n\nprint(f'The response rate difference between the 1:1 and 2:1 match ratios {round(rr_diff_11_vs_21, 3)}')\nprint(f'The response rate difference between the 2:1 and 3:1 match ratios {round(rr_diff_21_vs_31, 3)}')\n\n\nThe response rate difference between the 1:1 and 2:1 match ratios 0.002\nThe response rate difference between the 2:1 and 3:1 match ratios 0.0\n\n\nRecall the linear regression result above:\n\n\nCode\nlr.coef.round(3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nindex\ncoefficient\nstd.error\nt.value\np.value\n\n\n\n\n\n0\nIntercept\n0.018\n0.001\n16.225\n0.000\n***\n\n\n1\nratio1\n0.003\n0.002\n1.661\n0.097\n.\n\n\n2\nratio2\n0.005\n0.002\n2.744\n0.006\n**\n\n\n3\nratio3\n0.005\n0.002\n2.802\n0.005\n**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ncoef_ratio1 = 0.003\ncoef_ratio2 = 0.005\ncoef_ratio3 = 0.005\n\ncoef_11_vs_21 = coef_ratio2 - coef_ratio1\ncoef_21_vs_31 = coef_ratio3 - coef_ratio2\n\nprint(f'The response rate difference between the 1:1 and 2:1 match ratios from regression is {round(coef_11_vs_21, 3)}')\nprint(f'The response rate difference between the 2:1 and 3:1 match ratios from regression is {round(coef_21_vs_31, 3)}')\n\n\nThe response rate difference between the 1:1 and 2:1 match ratios from regression is 0.002\nThe response rate difference between the 2:1 and 3:1 match ratios from regression is 0.0\n\n\n1:1 vs 2:1 : The very small difference (0.002) suggests only a marginal improvement in the response rate from the 1:1 and 2:1 match ratio. This indicates that while the 2:1 match ratio might be slightly more effective than 1:1, the difference is minimal\n2:1 vs 3:1 The zero difference suggest that there is no additional benefit in increasing the match ratio from 2:1 to 3:1 regarding the likelihood of donations. This suggests diminishing returns when the match ratio increase beyond 2:1\nThese findings imply that while increasing the match ratio from 1:1 to 2:1 might offer a slight increase in donation likelihood, increasing it further to 3:1 does not yield additional benefits. This could be crucial for organizations in deciding how aggressively to pursue higher matching ratios in their fundraising strategies. The minimal differences suggest that other factors may be more critical in influencing donation behavior than merely adjusting the match ratio."

This p-value is slightly above the conventional threshold of 0.05, indicating that the difference in average donation amounts between the treatment and control groups is not statistically significant at the 5% level. However, the p-value is close to the threshold, suggesting a potential trend where the treatment group might have higher donation amounts than the control group, though this difference isn‚Äôt strong enough to be considered statistically significant.\n\nLinear Regression\n\n\nCode\nlr = rsm.model.regress(\n    data = data,\n    rvar = 'amount',\n    evar = 'treatment'\n)\nlr.coef.round(3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nindex\ncoefficient\nstd.error\nt.value\np.value\n\n\n\n\n\n0\nIntercept\n0.813\n0.067\n12.063\n0.000\n***\n\n\n1\ntreatment\n0.154\n0.083\n1.861\n0.063\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinear Regression Results:\nIntercept: 0.8133\nThis suggests that the average donation amount for the control group is approximately 0.813 units.\nCoefficient for Treatment: 0.154\nThis indicates that being in the treatment group is associated with an increase in the donation amount by approximately 0.154 units compared to the control group.\nP-Value for Treatment: 0.063\nThe p-value is slightly above the conventional threshold of 0.05, indicating that the effect of treatment on donation amount is not statistically significant at the 5% level. However, it‚Äôs close, suggesting a potential positive impact of the treatment on donation amounts.\nOverall Interpretation: Both the t-test and the linear regression suggest that the treatment might have a slight positive effect on donation amounts, but this effect does not reach statistical significance. This could imply that while the treatment potentially influences donations positively, the effect is not large or consistent enough across the sample to conclude definitively about its effectiveness. It‚Äôs also possible that other variables not considered here could be influencing the donations, and including those in the model could potentially change these results.\n\n\nLimit only those who made a donation:\n\n\nCode\ndata_donated = data[data['amount'] &gt; 0]\n\n\n\nT-Test\n\n\nCode\ndonated_treatment = data_donated.loc[data_donated['treatment'] == 1,'amount']\ndonated_control = data_donated.loc[data_donated['treatment'] == 0,'amount']\n\n# Apply the t_values function that we defined above\nt_value_donated = t_value(donated_treatment, donated_control)\nprint(f\"T_value is {t_value_donated}\")\n\n\nT_value is -0.5846089783693985\n\n\n\n\nCode\n#Apply the degree of freedom funcion that we defined above\ndof_donated = dof(donated_treatment, donated_control)\nprint(f\"Degree of freedom is {dof_donated}\")\n\n\nDegree of freedom is 557.4599283248195\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Find p-value\np_value = t.cdf(t_value_donated, dof_donated)*2\nprint(f\"P_value is {p_value}\")\n\n\nP_value is 0.5590471873269819\n\n\nThe t-statistic of -0.5846 suggests a lower average donation amount in the treatment group compared to the control group among donors, though the difference is minor.\nThe p-value of 0.559 indicates that this difference is not statistically significant. This means we do not have sufficient evidence to conclude that the treatment affects donation amounts among those who donate.\n\n\nLinear Regression\n\n\nCode\nlr = rsm.model.regress(\n    data = data_donated,\n    rvar = 'amount',\n    evar = 'treatment'\n)\nlr.coef.round(3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nindex\ncoefficient\nstd.error\nt.value\np.value\n\n\n\n\n\n0\nIntercept\n45.540\n2.423\n18.792\n0.000\n***\n\n\n1\ntreatment\n-1.668\n2.872\n-0.581\n0.561\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTreatment Coefficient: The coefficient for the treatment group is approximately -1.67 with a standard error of about 2.87. This suggests that, on average, the treatment group donated about 1.67 units less than the control group among those who donated.\nStatistical Significance: P-value for the Treatment: The p-value for the treatment effect is 0.561, which is not statistically significant. This implies that there is no strong evidence to suggest that the treatment effect differs from zero in the population of donors.\nThe negatice coefficient for the treatment group suggests that the treatment potentially lead to a decrease in the amount donated compared to the control group among those who donated. However, the lack of statistical significance (p-value &gt; 0.05) means we can not confidently assert that this treatment effect is different from zero in the broader donor population.\nCausal Interpretation:\nWhether the treatment coefficient can be interpreted causally depends on how the treatment was assigned. If the treatment was randomly assigned to participants, then the coefficient could potentially have a causal interpretation. Random assignment would help control for both observed and unobserved confounding variables, allowing us to attribute differences in outcomes directly to the treatment effect.\nWhat Did We Learn?\nThe analysis indicates that among those who chose to donate, the treatment did not significantly increase donation amounts. In fact, the point estimate suggests a slight decrease in donations, but this result is not statistically significant. This finding helps understand the treatment‚Äôs impact specifically on the subset of the population that decides to donate, complementing the broader analysis which includes non-donors.\n\n\nPlots\n\n\nCode\n# Prepare the plots for treatment and control groups who made donations\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=1, ncols=2, figsize=(14, 6))\n\n# Plot for Treatment Group\naxes[0].hist(donated_treatment, bins=30, color='blue', alpha=0.7)\naxes[0].axvline(donated_treatment.mean(), color='red', linestyle='dashed', linewidth=1)\naxes[0].set_title('Treatment Group Donation Amounts')\naxes[0].set_xlabel('Donation Amount')\naxes[0].set_ylabel('Frequency')\naxes[0].text(donated_treatment.mean(), max(axes[0].get_ylim()) * 0.5, f'Average: {donated_treatment.mean():.2f}', color='red')\n\n# Plot for Control Group\naxes[1].hist(donated_control, bins=30, color='green', alpha=0.7)\naxes[1].axvline(donated_control.mean(), color='red', linestyle='dashed', linewidth=1)\naxes[1].set_title('Control Group Donation Amounts')\naxes[1].set_xlabel('Donation Amount')\naxes[1].set_ylabel('Frequency')\naxes[1].text(donated_control.mean(), max(axes[1].get_ylim()) * 0.5, f'Average: {donated_control.mean():.2f}', color='red')\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTreatment Group Donation Amounts:\nThe majority of donations are concentrated in the lower range of amounts, with the frequency decreasing as the amount increases.\nThere‚Äôs a significant frequency at the lowest amount, indicating that many donations are of a small value.\nThe average donation amount in the treatment group is indicated by a vertical dotted red line and is annotated as $43.87.\nControl Group Donation Amounts:\nSimilar to the treatment group, most donations are of a lower amount, with frequency tapering off for higher donation amounts.\nThe distribution of donations appears slightly more spread out than the treatment group, with some higher amounts being more frequent compared to the treatment group.\nThe average donation amount for the control group is slightly higher than the treatment group, marked by a vertical dotted red line, at $45.54.\nInterpretation:\n\nThe control group has a slightly higher average donation amount compared to the treatment group.\nBoth histograms appear right-skewed, which is common in financial data since a large number of small donations are often accompanied by a smaller number of much larger donations"

The differences are calculated for each trial as the outcome of the treatment minus the outcome of the control.\nRed dashed line: This line marks the true difference in means between the probabilities of making a donation in the treatment and control groups, which is p_treatment - p_control = 0.022 - 0.018 = 0.004.\n\nObservations from the plot\nThe blue line, or the cumulative average of differences, fluctuates initially but starts to stabilize and approach the red dashed line as the number of trials increases. This behavior exemplifies the Law of Large Numbers, which states that as the number of trials increases, the sample average will converge to the expected value (in this case, the true difference in means).\nThe plot confirms that with a sufficient number of trials, the cumulative average of the differences in donation behavior between the treatment and control groups approaches the true difference in means. This simulation reinforces our understanding of statistical concepts like the Law of Large Numbers and provides a visual affirmation that with enough data, our estimates can reliably approximate true population parameters. This also supports the validity of using such statistical methods to evaluate the effects of interventions like charitable donation matches\n\n\nCentral Limit Theorem\n\n\nCode\n# Define sample sizes to simulate\nsample_sizes = [50, 200, 500, 1000]\n\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=1, ncols=4, figsize=(20, 5), sharey=True)\n\n# Simulate the process and plot the histograms\nfor i, sample_size in enumerate(sample_sizes):\n    # Simulate drawing samples and calculating the means 1000 times\n    sample_means = np.array([np.mean(np.random.binomial(1, p_treatment, sample_size) - \n                                     np.random.binomial(1, p_control, sample_size)) \n                             for _ in range(1000)])\n    \n    # Plot the histogram\n    axes[i].hist(sample_means, bins=30, orientation='horizontal', color='blue', alpha=0.6, edgecolor='black')\n    \n    # Calculate the mean and standard deviation for the normal distribution curve\n    mean_of_sample_means = np.mean(sample_means)\n    std_dev_of_sample_means = np.std(sample_means)\n\n    # Generate values for the normal distribution curve\n    curve_x = np.linspace(mean_of_sample_means - 3 * std_dev_of_sample_means, \n                          mean_of_sample_means + 3 * std_dev_of_sample_means, 100)\n    curve_y = (1 / (std_dev_of_sample_means * np.sqrt(2 * np.pi)) *\n               np.exp(-(curve_x - mean_of_sample_means) ** 2 / (2 * std_dev_of_sample_means ** 2)))\n    \n    # Scale the curve y to match the histogram scale\n    curve_y_scaled = curve_y * max(np.histogram(sample_means, bins=30)[0]) / max(curve_y)\n    \n    # Draw the normal distribution curve as a red line\n    axes[i].plot(curve_y_scaled, curve_x, '-')\n\n    # Add a red dashed line at the true difference\n    axes[i].axhline(y=0.004, color='red', linestyle='dashed', linewidth=2)\n\n    # Set titles and labels\n    axes[i].set_title(f'Sample Size {sample_size}')\n    axes[i].set_xlabel('Frequency' if i == len(sample_sizes) - 1 else '')  # Only add xlabel to the last subplot\n    axes[i].set_ylabel('Average Difference' if i == 0 else '')  # Only add ylabel to the first subplot\n\n# Adjust layout for better fit\nplt.tight_layout()\n\n# Show the plot\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we can see:\nSample Size 50: There is considerable variability around the true difference, indicating that smaller sample sizes can produce estimates that fluctuate widely.\nSample Size 200: The histogram becomes tighter around the true difference, with less variability than the sample size of 50.\nSample Size 500: Further reduction in variability is observed, and the distribution of averages is centered closely around the true difference.\nSample Size 1000: This histogram shows the least variability, and the average differences are clustering tightly around the true difference, with the center of the distribution aligning closely with the red line.\nLaw of Large Numbers: As the sample size increases, the cumulative average difference becomes more consistent and stable around the true difference. This is a demonstration of the Law of Large Numbers‚Äîthe sample averages converge to the expected value as the sample size grows.\nCentral Limit Theorem: As the sample size increases, the distribution of sample means (average differences in this case) becomes more symmetrical and bell-shaped, which is evidence of the Central Limit Theorem in action. The sample means for larger sample sizes tend to form a normal distribution centered around the true population mean.\nZero in the Distribution: In all histograms, the zero mark is not in the middle of the distribution; it‚Äôs in the left tail. This is because the treatment group has a higher probability of donating than the control group (0.022 vs.¬†0.018), so the true difference is expected to be positive (0.004), not zero."

This suggests a positive relationship between the age of the patent application (or applicant) and the likelihood of success.With p &lt; 0.001, this variable indicates a strong positive relationship with the outcome as age increases, up to a point (due to the quadratic term).\nage squared:The negative coefficient for age squared indicates a diminishing return effect; as age increases, its positive impact on patent success starts to decrease. This typically suggests a peak point beyond which additional years in age reduce the likelihood of success. Also with p &lt; 0.001, it confirms the non-linear relationship where increasing age has diminishing returns on the log odds of the outcome.\niscustomer: Being a customer is associated with an increase in the log-odds of patent success by 0.1181 compared to non-customers. This effect is statistically significant and suggests that customers of Blueprinty might have a higher likelihood of patent success. This variable is statistically significant (p = 0.002), showing that being a customer positively influences the outcome.\nRegional Effects:\n\n\nNortheast: Indicates a positive effect on patent success in the Northeast compared to the baseline region (the one dropped during dummy coding).\nNorthwest: Suggests a slight negative effect on patent success compared to the baseline, but this may not be statistically significant.\nSouth and Southwest: Both regions show a positive effect on patent success, though the effects are small and the confidence around these estimates might overlap with zero, suggesting limited statistical significance.\n\nConclusions:\n\nAge: There‚Äôs a clear positive relationship between age and patent success, which peaks and then starts to decline as indicated by the quadratic term (age squared). This could reflect that mid-career individuals or entities are most successful in patent applications, possibly due to optimal combinations of experience and active engagement in their fields.\nCustomer Status: Being a customer of Blueprinty has a positive impact on patent success. This suggests that the services or products provided by Blueprinty are effective in enhancing the success rate of patents for their customers.\nRegional Variations: There are some regional differences in patent success rates, with the Northeast and Southern regions showing a positive impact relative to the baseline region."

This suggests a positive relationship between the age of the patent application (or applicant) and the likelihood of success.With p &lt; 0.001, this variable indicates a strong positive relationship with the outcome as age increases, up to a point (due to the quadratic term).\nage squared:The negative coefficient for age squared indicates a diminishing return effect; as age increases, its positive impact on patent success starts to decrease. This typically suggests a peak point beyond which additional years in age reduce the likelihood of success. Also with p &lt; 0.001, it confirms the non-linear relationship where increasing age has diminishing returns on the log odds of the outcome.\niscustomer: Being a customer is associated with an increase in the log-odds of patent success by 0.1181 compared to non-customers. This effect is statistically significant and suggests that customers of Blueprinty might have a higher likelihood of patent success. This variable is statistically significant (p = 0.002), showing that being a customer positively influences the outcome.\nRegional Effects:\n\n\nNortheast: Indicates a positive effect on patent success in the Northeast compared to the baseline region (the one dropped during dummy coding).\nNorthwest: Suggests a slight negative effect on patent success compared to the baseline, but this may not be statistically significant.\nSouth and Southwest: Both regions show a positive effect on patent success, though the effects are small and the confidence around these estimates might overlap with zero, suggesting limited statistical significance.\n\nConclusions:\n\nAge: There‚Äôs a clear positive relationship between age and patent success, which peaks and then starts to decline as indicated by the quadratic term (age squared). This could reflect that mid-career individuals or entities are most successful in patent applications, possibly due to optimal combinations of experience and active engagement in their fields.\nCustomer Status: Being a customer of Blueprinty has a positive impact on patent success. This suggests that the services or products provided by Blueprinty are effective in enhancing the success rate of patents for their customers.\nRegional Variations: There are some regional differences in patent success rates, with the Northeast and Southern regions showing a positive impact relative to the baseline region."

An alternative approach is to create a binary indicator variable for each of these scores, which will indicate whether the score was originally missing. This way, we retain all listings in our analysis and potentially capture some information about why scores might be missing (e.g., newer listings might not have scores yet).\nImpute missing review scores with the median\n\n\nCode\n# Create binary indicators for missing review scores\nairbnb['cleanliness_missing'] = airbnb['review_scores_cleanliness'].isnull().astype(int)\nairbnb['location_missing'] = airbnb['review_scores_location'].isnull().astype(int)\nairbnb['value_missing'] = airbnb['review_scores_value'].isnull().astype(int)\n\n# Impute missing review scores with the median\nairbnb['review_scores_cleanliness'].fillna(airbnb['review_scores_cleanliness'].median(), inplace=True)\nairbnb['review_scores_location'].fillna(airbnb['review_scores_location'].median(), inplace=True)\nairbnb['review_scores_value'].fillna(airbnb['review_scores_value'].median(), inplace=True)\n\n# Check if all missing values are addressed\nfinal_missing_values_check = airbnb.isnull().sum()\nfinal_missing_values_check\n\n\nid                            0\ndays                          0\nlast_scraped                  0\nhost_since                   35\nroom_type                     0\nbathrooms                     0\nbedrooms                      0\nprice                         0\nnumber_of_reviews             0\nreview_scores_cleanliness     0\nreview_scores_location        0\nreview_scores_value           0\ninstant_bookable              0\ncleanliness_missing           0\nlocation_missing              0\nvalue_missing                 0\ndtype: int64\n\n\nAll the missing values in the review scores have been addressed, and we now have binary indicators for whether the original scores were missing.

The logarithmic scale on price helps in visualizing this across a wide range of values.\nReview Scores:\nThere isn‚Äôt a clear trend in the scatter plots between review scores and the number of reviews, indicating that while scores may affect guest satisfaction, they do not necessarily correlate directly with the frequency of bookings (as measured by reviews). There might be a slight increase in reviews with higher scores for cleanliness and value.\n\n\nBuild Poisson Regression Model\n\n\nCode\nfrom patsy import dmatrices\n# Convert variables to the same time interval\n\nairbnb['last_scraped'] = pd.to_datetime(airbnb['last_scraped'])\nairbnb['host_since'] = pd.to_datetime(airbnb['host_since'])\n\n# Calculate the duration in years that each listing has been active\nairbnb['duration_years'] = (airbnb['last_scraped'] - airbnb['host_since']).dt.days / 365.25\n\n# Compute reviews per year\nairbnb['reviews_per_year'] = airbnb['number_of_reviews'] / airbnb['duration_years']\n\n# Handle cases where duration_years is zero to avoid division by zero\nairbnb['reviews_per_year'].fillna(0, inplace=True)\n\n\n# Encoding categorical variables using patsy (for statsmodels compatibility)\nformula = \"\"\"reviews_per_year ~ room_type + bathrooms + bedrooms + price +\n             review_scores_cleanliness + review_scores_location +\n             review_scores_value + cleanliness_missing + location_missing + value_missing\"\"\"\n\n# Prepare the design matrices for regression\ny, X = dmatrices(formula, airbnb, return_type='dataframe')\n\n# Fit a Poisson regression model using the same training data\npoisson_model = sm.GLM(y, X, family=sm.families.Poisson())\npoisson_results = poisson_model.fit()\n\npoisson_summary = poisson_results.summary()\n\n# Extract only the regression results table\npoisson_results_table = poisson_summary.tables[1]\n\n# To display or print out the table\nprint(poisson_results_table)\n\n\n=============================================================================================\n                                coef    std err          z      P&gt;|z|      [0.025      0.975]\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIntercept                     2.1560      0.026     84.372      0.000       2.106       2.206\nroom_type[T.Private room]     0.0338      0.004      7.737      0.000       0.025       0.042\nroom_type[T.Shared room]      0.0871      0.012      7.525      0.000       0.064       0.110\nbathrooms                     0.0105      0.006      1.903      0.057      -0.000       0.021\nbedrooms                      0.0811      0.003     25.960      0.000       0.075       0.087\nprice                        -0.0002   1.86e-05    -12.370      0.000      -0.000      -0.000\nreview_scores_cleanliness     0.1249      0.002     53.488      0.000       0.120       0.129\nreview_scores_location       -0.0711      0.003    -28.236      0.000      -0.076      -0.066\nreview_scores_value          -0.0577      0.003    -20.285      0.000      -0.063      -0.052\ncleanliness_missing          -2.2750      0.122    -18.625      0.000      -2.514      -2.036\nlocation_missing             -1.1305      0.148     -7.651      0.000      -1.420      -0.841\nvalue_missing                -1.4111      0.145     -9.734      0.000      -1.695      -1.127\n=============================================================================================\n\n\n\n\nBuild Binomial Regression Model\n\n\nCode\n# #

Since this scenario isn‚Äôt realistic, it primarily serves as baseline for the model\nroom_type\n\n\nPrivate room: listings that are private rooms have slightly more reviews compared to entire homes/apartments, holding other factors constant. The effect is relatively small\nShare room: Shared rooms are expected to have more reviews than the baseline category. Shared rooms show a stronger positive association with the number of reviews compared to private rooms.\n\n\nbathrooms: More bathrooms are associated with more reviews, indicating that listings with more bathrooms might be more frequently booked or reviewed.\nbedrooms: More bedrooms are associated with an increase in the expected count of reviews, suggesting that larger properties might attract more bookings and thus more reviews\nprice: A higher price is slightly negatively associated with the number of reviews. This small coeficient suggests that price inceases might slightly reduce the likelihood of getting reviewed.\nReview scores:\n\n\ncleanliness: higher clealiness scrores are positively associated with more reviews, indicating that cleanser listings are more likely to receive reviews.\nlocation: Surprisingly, better location scores are associated with fewer reviews. This might reflex a complex interaction with other factors not captured in the model or the properties in desiable locations might not meet all guest expectations or that guests in such locations review less frequently.\nvalue: Better value scores are also negatively associated with the number of reviews, which might suggest that guest have higher expectations that aren‚Äôt met as often they rate the value highly.\n\n\nMissing Indicators:\n\n\ncleanliness missing: Listing missing cleanliness scores have significantly fewer reviews, possibly indicating newer or less popular listings.\nlocation missing: Similarly, listings missing location scores have fewer reviews\nvalue missing: Listing missing value scores also have fewer reviews."

The uplift becomes negative in the last deciles, indicating that targeting these segments would result in worse outcomes than if they were not targeted at all.\nNegative uplift in the later deciles could indicate that the campaign has a counterproductive effect on these individuals or that they would have been better or equally likely to take the desired action without the campaign intervention.\n\n\n\n4.

This suggests that while the propensity model can identify likely responders, the uplift model is better at identifying those for whom the treatment would make a difference in their behavior.\n\n\n\nCode\nfig = rsm.uplift_plot(\n    cg_rct_stacked.query(\"training == 0\"),\n    \"converted\",\n    \"yes\",\n    [\"pred_treatment\", \"uplift_score\"],\n    \"ad\",\n    1, qnt = 20\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUplift Distribution: Both sets of bars show a decrease in uplift as we move through the population segments, which is expected as the most responsive individuals are often targeted first.\nModel Comparison: In some segments, the uplift_score bars are higher than the pred_treatment bars, reinforcing the idea that the uplift model is more effective in certain segments.\nNegative Uplift: Towards the latter segments, both models show negative uplift, but the uplift_score model tends to have less severe negative values. The uplift model places customers with high incrementality in earlier deciles. The incrementality is lower for propensity model because it targets Persuadables and Sure Things whereas the uplift model targets only the former. This suggests that the uplift model may be better at minimizing the risk of targeting individuals who would have a negative response to the treatment.\n\nThat said, the propensity model still performs well here; this is because the customers who have the best propensity also tend to have the best uplift in this data:\n\n\nCode\ncm = rsm.correlation(\n    {\"cg_rct_stacked\": cg_rct_stacked.loc[cg_rct_stacked.training == 0, \"pred_treatment\": \"uplift_score\"]})\ncm.summary()\n\n\nCorrelation\nData     : cg_rct_stacked\nMethod   : pearson\nCutoff   : 0\nVariables: pred_treatment, pred_control, uplift_score\nNull hyp.: variables x and y are not correlated\nAlt. hyp.: variables x and y are correlated\n\nCorrelation matrix:\n             pred_treatment pred_control\npred_control           0.28             \nuplift_score           0.55        -0.65\n\np.values:\n             pred_treatment pred_control\npred_control            0.0             \nuplift_score            0.0          0.0\n\n\nThe positive correlation between pred_treatment and uplift_score is in line with what we would expect, as a higher predicted treatment response should correspond with a higher uplift score. The negative correlation between pred_control and uplift_score suggests that individuals who are likely to respond without any intervention (as predicted by the control model) are properly being identified as not contributing to uplift, which is a desirable feature of a good uplift model.\n\n\n6. Use the incremental_resp to calculate the profits for Propensity Model\n\n\nCode\npropensity_profit_logit = prof_calc(propensity_tab, 14.99, 1.5)\npropensity_profit_logit\n\n\n32065.482935153585\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Difference in profits from using uplift model and propensity model\ndifference_logit = uplift_profit_logit - propensity_profit_logit\ndifference_logit\n\n\n13842.276826396348\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing Neural Network\n\n2.

The treatment model shows positive uplift in the early segments but drops off more sharply than the uplift model in later segments, indicating that the treatment model might be less effective at distinguishing between those who will respond due to the treatment and those who would have responded anyway.\nThe uplift model has a more gradual decline in uplift across segments and less negative uplift in the lower segments, which could imply that it is more effective at targeting the right individuals.\nThe negative values in later segments for both models suggest that certain individuals are either not influenced by or negatively influenced by the treatment.

This indicates that targeting more of the population is initially resulting in a higher incremental gain.\nThe curve shows a steep initial growth in uplift as the targeting begins, suggesting that the early segments of the population targeted are highly responsive to the campaign.\nAfter a certain point, the rate of increase in incremental uplift starts to diminish. This is seen as the curve begins to flatten, suggesting that the additional gains from targeting more of the population are decreasing.\nThe curve reaches a peak and then plateaus, indicating that there is an optimal point of targeting beyond which the incremental benefits do not increase significantly. This is typically where the marketer would aim to stop targeting additional customers to maximize efficiency and return on investment.\n\n\n\nCode\nfig = rsm.uplift_plot(\n    cg_rct_stacked.query(\"training == 0\"), \"converted\", \"yes\", \"uplift_score_rf\", \"ad\", 1, qnt = 20\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first few bars show a positive uplift, with the first bar indicating an uplift of approximately 30%. This suggests that the first segment of the population (likely the top 5% or 10%) responded very well to the intervention.\nAs moving right along the x-axis, the uplift decreases. This is expected as typically, the individuals most likely to respond are targeted first, and as moving through the population, the less responsive individuals are included.\nEventually, the uplift drops to 0% and then becomes negative. The negative bars at the end suggest that targeting those segments of the population may have been counterproductive, either because the intervention had an adverse effect or because it was an unnecessary expense for those individuals who might have taken the desired action without any intervention.\nThe most negative bar, located towards the right end of the chart, indicates a significant negative impact on that segment. This might represent a group that was either deterred by the campaign or where the cost of targeting outweighed the benefits.\n\n\n\n4.

Calculate the uplift and Increatmental Uplift for Propensity Model\n\n\nCode\nprop_tab_rf = rsm.uplift_tab(\n    cg_rct_stacked.query(\"training == 0\"), \"converted\", \"yes\", \"pred_treatment_rf\", \"ad\", 1, qnt = 20\n)\n\n\n\n\nCompare Uplift model and Propensity model\n\n\nCode\nfig = rsm.inc_uplift_plot(\n    cg_rct_stacked.query(\"training == 0\"),\n    \"converted\",\n    \"yes\",\n    [\"pred_treatment_rf\", \"uplift_score_rf\"],\n    \"ad\",\n    1, qnt = 20\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUplift Model: The line representing uplift_score_rf is consistently above the pred_treatment_rf line, suggesting that the uplift model identifies individuals who will respond to the treatment more effectively than the propensity model alone. This indicates that using the uplift model, the campaign would yield a higher incremental gain across the targeted population segments.\nPropensity Model: The pred_treatment_rf line shows that the propensity model does predict some level of uplift, but it is lower compared to the uplift model. This implies that while the propensity model identifies individuals likely to respond to the treatment, it does not do so as effectively as the uplift model when it comes to maximizing incremental uplift.\nDiminishing Returns: Both models show an increase in incremental uplift as a larger percentage of the population is targeted, but the rate of increase slows down, and both lines begin to plateau. This indicates diminishing returns; beyond a certain point, targeting additional segments of the population yields progressively smaller increases in uplift.\nOptimal Targeting Point: The point at which the curves start to plateau suggests the optimal targeting point for the campaign. Beyond this point, the additional cost of targeting more individuals may not be justified by the incremental gains.\n\n\n\nCode\nfig = rsm.uplift_plot(\n    cg_rct_stacked.query(\"training == 0\"),\n    \"converted\",\n    \"yes\",\n    [\"pred_treatment_rf\", \"uplift_score_rf\"],\n    \"ad\",\n    1, qnt = 20\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInitial Segments: The first few segments, representing the most responsive parts of the population, show a significant positive uplift for both models. This suggests that both models are effective at identifying the individuals most likely to be influenced by the campaign.\nDecreasing Uplift: As moving to the right, representing a larger share of the population being targeted, the uplift for both models decreases. This is typical in targeted marketing as the most responsive individuals are usually the first ones targeted.\nNegative Uplift: Towards the end segments, both models show negative uplift, which can indicate that targeting these individuals may have a counterproductive effect. It could mean that the campaign is reaching individuals who either would have made a purchase without the campaign or who may be turned off by the campaign.\nComparison Between Models: In most segments, the uplift_score_rf bars are higher than the pred_treatment_rf bars, suggesting that the uplift model is more effective at identifying which segments of the population will provide a higher incremental uplift when targeted.\n\n\n\n6.

This indicates that targeting more of the population is initially resulting in higher incremental gains.\nThe curve shows a steep rise in incremental uplift at the beginning, suggesting that the early segments of the population targeted are highly responsive to the campaign.\nThe rate of increase in incremental uplift begins to slow down as the curve extends towards the right, which suggests diminishing returns; the incremental gains from targeting additional portions of the population decrease.\nThe curve eventually starts to plateau, indicating that there is a point at which the incremental benefits do not significantly increase with additional targeting. This plateau represents the point of maximum efficiency in targeting efforts.\n\nThe graph is indicative of a typical response to a well-targeted marketing campaign, where the most responsive individuals are targeted first, leading to higher uplifts early on. As less responsive individuals are targeted, the incremental uplift decreases\n\n\nCode\nfig = rsm.uplift_plot(\n    cg_rct_stacked.query(\"training == 0\"), \n    \"converted\", \"yes\", \"pred_treatment_xgb\", \"ad\", 1, qnt = 20)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHigh Responsiveness in Early Segments: The first few bars are the tallest, indicating the highest uplift. This suggests that the first segment of the population (likely the top 5% or 10%) is the most responsive to the campaign.\nDiminishing Returns: As we move right across the x-axis to include larger percentages of the population, the size of the uplift decreases. This pattern is typical in targeted marketing, where you see the greatest response rate increases in the first few population segments.\nConsistent Drop: The consistent drop-off in uplift as the population segments progress suggests that the most responsive individuals are targeted first, followed by progressively less responsive segments.\nPositive Uplift Across Segments: All the bars are above the 0% line, which indicates that each segment experienced a positive uplift due to the campaign. This means that even the least responsive segments targeted still had a positive response, although it was not as strong as the initial segments.\n\n\n\nCompare Uplift model and Propensity model\n\n\nCode\nfig = rsm.inc_uplift_plot(\n    cg_rct_stacked.query(\"training == 0\"),\n    \"converted\",\n    \"yes\",\n    [\"pred_treatment_xgb\", \"uplift_score_xgb\"],\n    \"ad\",\n    1, qnt = 20\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUplift Model Performance: The uplift_score_xgb curve is consistently above the pred_treatment_xgb curve. This indicates that the uplift model is predicting a higher incremental uplift across the different segments of the targeted population compared to the treatment model.\nPropensity Model: The pred_treatment_xgb curve shows that the propensity model also predicts an increase in incremental uplift with more of the population targeted. However, the uplift is not as high as the one predicted by the uplift model, suggesting that the propensity model might be useful, but not optimal.\nDiminishing Returns: Both models show an initial rapid increase in incremental uplift, which slows and eventually plateaus as the percentage of the population targeted increases. This is indicative of diminishing returns; beyond a certain point, targeting additional people results in smaller increases in incremental uplift.\nOptimal Targeting Point: The curves suggest that there is an optimal point for targeting, after which the incremental benefits of targeting additional individuals begin to decrease. Identifying this point can help optimize marketing efforts and budget allocation.\n\nIn short, the uplift_score_xgb model appears to be more effective for targeting the right individuals, likely because it accounts for the incremental effect of the treatment, identifying those who are influenced by the campaign as opposed to those who would respond without it.\n\n\nCode\nfig = rsm.uplift_plot(\n    cg_rct_stacked.query(\"training == 0\"),\n    \"converted\",\n    \"yes\",\n    [\"pred_treatment_xgb\", \"uplift_score_xgb\"],\n    \"ad\",\n    1, qnt = 20\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHigh Responsiveness in Early Segments: The initial segments show a higher uplift for both models. This indicates that these segments of the population are more responsive to the marketing campaign.\nDecreasing Uplift: As the segments progress from left to right (targeting a larger share of the population), the uplift decreases. This trend is typical in targeted marketing, where the most responsive individuals are usually targeted first.\nNegative Uplift in Later Segments: For the segments on the right, the uplift becomes negative. This could mean that targeting these individuals might be counterproductive, potentially leading to a negative reaction to the marketing campaign or an unnecessary cost for individuals who would have made a purchase without any intervention.\nComparison Between Models: In most segments, the uplift_score_xgb bars appear to have a higher uplift than the pred_treatment_xgb bars, suggesting that the uplift model is more effective at identifying which segments of the population will provide a higher incremental uplift when targeted.\n\n\n\n6.

What formula would you use to select customers to target using a propensity model if your goal is to maximize expected profits?\nTo select customers to target using a propensity to buy model with the goal of maximizing our expected profits, we want to use a formula that incorporates both the propensity to buy and the expected profit from each customer if they do purchase. This approach allows the prioritization of customers not just based on their likelihood to buy, but also on the value they bring. The propensity model is a more general approach that can be used to predict the likelihood of a customer to purchase a product or service. The formula to select customers to target using a propensity model if the goal is to maximize expected profits is as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Customers to target} = (\\text{price}* {pred_i} - \\text{cost}) &gt; 0\n\\]\n\n\nCode\nprice = 14.99\ncost = 1.50\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndef round_to_nearest_5(x):\n    return round(x*20) / 20\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Run the function accross all models and predictions\nmodels = ['logit', 'nn', 'rf', 'xgb']\npredictions = ['pred_treatment', 'pred_treatment_nn', 'pred_treatment_rf', 'pred_treatment_xgb']\n\n# Define optimization function for profit\ndef propensity_prof_opt(data, price = 14.99, cost = 1.5):\n    total_customers = 120000\n    result = []\n    for model, prediction in zip(models, predictions):\n        data['EP'] = data[prediction] * price - cost\n        data['ads_logit'] = data['EP'] &gt; 0\n        perc = np.nanmean(data['ads_logit'])\n        target_customers = perc * total_customers\n        rounded_perc = round_to_nearest_5(perc)\n        result.append([model, perc, rounded_perc, target_customers])\n    return pd.DataFrame(result, columns = ['model','perc_customer', 'rounded_perc', 'target_customers']).sort_values('perc_customer', ascending = False)\n\npropensity_prof_opt = propensity_prof_opt(cg_rct_stacked.query(\"training == 1 & ad == 1\"))\npropensity_prof_opt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmodel\nperc_customer\nrounded_perc\ntarget_customers\n\n\n\n\n3\nxgb\n0.485571\n0.50\n58268.571429\n\n\n0\nlogit\n0.478524\n0.50\n57422.857143\n\n\n1\nnn\n0.439286\n0.45\n52714.285714\n\n\n2\nrf\n0.223524\n0.20\n26822.857143\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, we want to target customers using logit propensity model for each tuned model to maximize the expected profits.\n\nLogistic Regression Model: 57,422 customers\nNeural Network Model: 54,005 customers\nRandom Forest Model: 27222 customers\nXGBoost Model: 58,268 customers\n\n\n\nUplift Expected Profit\nIf we wanted to target customers using an uplift model, we will select customers with the highest predicted uplift scores, where uplift is the incremental impact of the treatment (e.g., receiving an ad) on the customer‚Äôs probability of making a purchase.\n The expected incremental profit can be calculated by multiplying the uplift score by the profit per conversion minus the cost of targeting the client. The formula is listed below:\n\\[\n\\text{Customers to target} = ({\\text{Uplift Score} * \\text{profit per conversion}) - \\text{Cost per conversion}}\n\\]\nThe uplift score is calculated by subtracting the probability of the customer to purchase without the treatment from the probability of the customer to purchase with the treatment.\n\\[\n\\text{Uplift Score} = \\text{P(Outcome|Treatment)} - \\text{P(Outcome|Control)}\n\\]\n\n\nCode\n# Optimizing the uplift model profit\n# Run the function accross all models and uplift scores\nmodels = ['logit', 'nn', 'rf', 'xgb']\nuplift_scores = ['uplift_score', 'uplift_score_nn', 'uplift_score_rf', 'uplift_score_xgb']\n\n# Define optimization function for profit\ndef uplift_prof_opt(data, price = 14.99, cost = 1.5):\n    total_customers = 120000\n    result = []\n    for model, uplift_score in zip(models,uplift_scores):\n        data['EIP'] = (data[uplift_score] * price) - cost\n        data['ads_logit'] = data['EIP'] &gt; 0\n        perc = np.nanmean(data['ads_logit'])\n        target_customers = perc * total_customers\n        rounded_perc = round_to_nearest_5(perc)\n        result.append([model, perc, rounded_perc, target_customers])\n    return pd.DataFrame(result, columns = ['model','perc_customer', 'rounded_perc', 'target_customers']).sort_values('perc_customer', ascending = False)\n\nuplift_prof_opt = uplift_prof_opt(cg_rct_stacked.query(\"training == 1 & ad == 1\"))\nuplift_prof_opt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmodel\nperc_customer\nrounded_perc\ntarget_customers\n\n\n\n\n1\nnn\n0.295000\n0.30\n35400.000000\n\n\n3\nxgb\n0.283048\n0.30\n33965.714286\n\n\n0\nlogit\n0.221905\n0.20\n26628.571429\n\n\n2\nrf\n0.138810\n0.15\n16657.142857\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTherefore, we want to target customers using uplift model for each tuned model to maximize the expected profits.\n\nLogistic Regression Model: 26,628 customers\nNeural Network Model: 36,068 customers\nRandom Forest Model: 16,982 customers\nXGBoost Model: 33,965 customers\n\n\n\n\nLogistic Model\n\n3. Uplift and Propensity Expected Profit\nIn questions 1 and 2, we calculated the optimal target of customers. for the propensity and uplift models. When we round to the nearest 5%, we will then use these percentages to calculate the number of customers to target out of the 120K customer base as well as calculate the expected incremental profits.\nTo calculate the incremental profits we will follow the general steps of: 1. Determining the incremental response. As we can see, the incremental_resp column shows the additional responses attributed to the treatment of the ad for each bin of customers. 2. We will then want to calculate the incremental profits for each bin. To do this, you will multiply the incremental response by the average profit per response, and we will assume an average profit per response value if not provided. 3. Finally, we will sum the incremental profits across all the bins to get the total incremental profit.\n\n\nCode\n# Define the function to calculate the profit\ndef prof_calc_opt(data, total_customers, percent_target, price = 14.99, cost = 1.5):\n    #

It targets a broader audience, including those who are already likely to convert without any intervention. The uplift model, on the other hand, targets only those who are likely to convert because of the intervention. This is why the propensity model is more effective in this case.\nThe propensity model is also used for broad targeting and segmentation, helping to focus resources on high-probability events. The uplift model is used for optimizing marketing campaigns and other interventions by targeting those individuals whose behavior can be positively changed by the intervention, thus maximizing ROI and reducing wastage. This causes the propensity model to capture a higher profit, where as the uplift model captures a higher ROI.\nIn essence, while both models are used to enhance decision-making in marketing and other fields, they serve different strategic purposes: propensity models for predicting actions based on existing propensities, and uplift models for identifying the additional impact of a particular action or intervention."

Estimating Yogurt Preferences\n\nLikelihood for the Multi-nomial Logit (MNL) Model\nSuppose we have \\(i=1,\\ldots,n\\) consumers who each select exactly one product \\(j\\) from a set of \\(J\\) products. The outcome variable is the identity of the product chosen \\(y_i \\in \\{1, \\ldots, J\\}\\) or equivalently a vector of \\(J-1\\) zeros and \\(1\\) one, where the \\(1\\) indicates the selected product. For example, if the third product was chosen out of 4 products, then either \\(y=3\\) or \\(y=(0,0,1,0)\\) depending on how we want to represent it. Suppose also that we have a vector of data on each product \\(x_j\\) (eg, size, price, etc.).\nWe model the consumer‚Äôs decision as the selection of the product that provides the most utility, and we‚Äôll specify the utility function as a linear function of the product characteristics:\n\\[ U_{ij} = x_j'\\beta + \\epsilon_{ij} \\]\nwhere \\(\\epsilon_{ij}\\) is an i.i.d. extreme value error term.\nThe choice of the i.i.d. extreme value error term leads to a closed-form expression for the probability that consumer \\(i\\) chooses product \\(j\\):\n\\[ \\mathbb{P}_i(j) = \\frac{e^{x_j'\\beta}}{\\sum_{k=1}^Je^{x_k'\\beta}} \\]\nFor example, if there are 4 products, the probability that consumer \\(i\\) chooses product 3 is:\n\\[ \\mathbb{P}_i(3) = \\frac{e^{x_3'\\beta}}{e^{x_1'\\beta} + e^{x_2'\\beta} + e^{x_3'\\beta} + e^{x_4'\\beta}} \\]\nA clever way to write the individual likelihood function for consumer \\(i\\) is the product of the \\(J\\) probabilities, each raised to the power of an indicator variable (\\(\\delta_{ij}\\)) that indicates the chosen product:\n\\[ L_i(\\beta) = \\prod_{j=1}^J \\mathbb{P}_i(j)^{\\delta_{ij}} = \\mathbb{P}_i(1)^{\\delta_{i1}} \\times \\ldots \\times \\mathbb{P}_i(J)^{\\delta_{iJ}}\\]\nNotice that if the consumer selected product \\(j=3\\), then \\(\\delta_{i3}=1\\) while \\(\\delta_{i1}=\\delta_{i2}=\\delta_{i4}=0\\) and the likelihood is:\n\\[ L_i(\\beta) = \\mathbb{P}_i(1)^0 \\times \\mathbb{P}_i(2)^0 \\times \\mathbb{P}_i(3)^1 \\times \\mathbb{P}_i(4)^0 = \\mathbb{P}_i(3) = \\frac{e^{x_3'\\beta}}{\\sum_{k=1}^Je^{x_k'\\beta}} \\]\nThe joint likelihood (across all consumers) is the product of the \\(n\\) individual likelihoods:\n\\[ L_n(\\beta) = \\prod_{i=1}^n L_i(\\beta) = \\prod_{i=1}^n \\prod_{j=1}^J \\mathbb{P}_i(j)^{\\delta_{ij}} \\]\nAnd the joint log-likelihood function is:\n\\[ \\ell_n(\\beta) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j=1}^J \\delta_{ij} \\log(\\mathbb{P}_i(j)) \\]\n\n\nYogurt Dataset\nWe will use the yogurt_data dataset, which provides anonymized consumer identifiers (id), a vector indicating the chosen product (y1:y4), a vector indicating if any products were ‚Äúfeatured‚Äù in the store as a form of advertising (f1:f4), and the products‚Äô prices (p1:p4). For example, consumer 1 purchased yogurt 4 at a price of 0.079/oz and none of the yogurts were featured/advertised at the time of consumer 1‚Äôs purchase. Consumers 2 through 7 each bought yogurt 2, etc.\n\nData Overview\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable Definitions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nid\nanonymized consumer identifiers.\n\n\ny1, y2, y3, y4\na vector indicating the chosen product.\n\n\nf1, f2, f3, f4\na vector indicating if any products were ‚Äúfeatured‚Äù in the store as a form of advertising\n\n\np1, p2, p3, p4\nthe products‚Äô prices\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nyogurt_data = pd.read_csv('yogurt_data.csv')\nyogurt_data.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid\ny1\ny2\ny3\ny4\nf1\nf2\nf3\nf4\np1\np2\np3\np4\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0.108\n0.081\n0.061\n0.079\n\n\n1\n2\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0.108\n0.098\n0.064\n0.075\n\n\n2\n3\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0.108\n0.098\n0.061\n0.086\n\n\n3\n4\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0.108\n0.098\n0.061\n0.086\n\n\n4\n5\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0.125\n0.098\n0.049\n0.079\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nyogurt_data.describe(include='all')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid\ny1\ny2\ny3\ny4\nf1\nf2\nf3\nf4\np1\np2\np3\np4\n\n\n\n\ncount\n2430.0000\n2430.000000\n2430.000000\n2430.000000\n2430.000000\n2430.000000\n2430.000000\n2430.000000\n2430.000000\n2430.000000\n2430.000000\n2430.000000\n2430.000000\n\n\nmean\n1215.5000\n0.341975\n0.401235\n0.029218\n0.227572\n0.055556\n0.039506\n0.037449\n0.037449\n0.106248\n0.081532\n0.053622\n0.079507\n\n\nstd\n701.6249\n0.474469\n0.490249\n0.168452\n0.419351\n0.229109\n0.194836\n0.189897\n0.189897\n0.020587\n0.011047\n0.008054\n0.007714\n\n\nmin\n1.0000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n-0.012000\n0.000000\n0.025000\n0.004000\n\n\n25%\n608.2500\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.103000\n0.081000\n0.050000\n0.079000\n\n\n50%\n1215.5000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.108000\n0.086000\n0.054000\n0.079000\n\n\n75%\n1822.7500\n1.000000\n1.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.115000\n0.086000\n0.061000\n0.086000\n\n\nmax\n2430.0000\n1.000000\n1.000000\n1.000000\n1.000000\n1.000000\n1.000000\n1.000000\n1.000000\n0.193000\n0.111000\n0.086000\n0.104000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatistics Summary:\n\nThere are 2,430 records.\nBinary fields (y1, y2, y3, y4, f1, f2, f3, f4) indicate varying levels of frequency with which different yogurts were chosen or conditions were met.\nPrice or index fields (p1, p2, p3, p4) show distributions with differing means, minima, and maxima, suggesting variability in yogurt pricing or attributes across the samples.\n\nLet the vector of product features include brand dummy variables for yogurts 1-3 (we‚Äôll omit a dummy for product 4 to avoid multi-collinearity), a dummy variable to indicate if a yogurt was featured, and a continuous variable for the yogurts‚Äô prices:\n\\[\nx_j' = \\left[ \\mathbb{1}(\\text{Yogurt 1}), \\mathbb{1}(\\text{Yogurt 2}), \\mathbb{1}(\\text{Yogurt 3}), X_f, X_p \\right]\n\\]\nThe ‚Äúhard part‚Äù of the MNL likelihood function is organizing the data, as we need to keep track of 3 dimensions (consumer \\(i\\), covariate \\(k\\), and product \\(j\\)) instead of the typical 2 dimensions for cross-sectional regression models (consumer \\(i\\) and covariate \\(k\\)).\nWhat we would like to do is reorganize the data from a ‚Äúwide‚Äù shape with \\(n\\) rows and multiple columns for each covariate, to a ‚Äúlong‚Äù shape with \\(n \\times J\\) rows and a single column for each covariate.

Here‚Äôs how to interpret these intercepts in the context of consumer preferences:\n\\(\\beta_1\\) (Yogurt 1): The positive and highest value among the three suggests that Yogurt 1 is the most preferred when no other attributes (like price or features) are considered. It has the highest intrinsic utility.\n\\(\\beta_2\\) (Yogurt 2): This is also positive but lower than \\(\\beta_1\\) , indicating that Yogurt 2 is less preferred than Yogurt 1 but still has a positive intrinsic appeal compared to a baseline (which could be another product not included in these three, like Yogurt 4 in this analysis).\n\\(\\beta_3\\) (Yogurt 3): The negative value here suggests that Yogurt 3 is least preferred among the three, having a lower intrinsic utility relative to the others.\nGiven these interpretations, Yogurt 1 appears to be the most preferred option among the first three, followed by Yogurt 2, with Yogurt 3 being the least preferred under the assumption that other factors are equal. This intrinsic preference could be driven by factors not explicitly modeled but captured by the intercepts, such as brand affinity, flavor preferences, or other unobserved attributes associated with each product.\nUse the estimated price coefficient as a dollar-per-util conversion factor. Use this conversion factor to calculate the dollar benefit between the most-preferred yogurt (the one with the highest intercept) and the least preferred yogurt (the one with the lowest intercept). This is a per-unit monetary measure of brand value.\n\n\nCode\n# Extracted beta values for Yogurt 1 and Yogurt 3 and the price coefficient\nbeta_1 = 1.39\nbeta_3 = -3.09\nbeta_p = -37.06  # The negative price coefficient\n\n# Calculate utility difference\nutility_difference = beta_1 - beta_3\n\n# Convert utility difference to dollar benefit using the price coefficient\ndollar_benefit = utility_difference / abs(beta_p)\n\nprint(\"Per-unit monetary measure of brand value is \", round(dollar_benefit, 4))\n\n\nPer-unit monetary measure of brand value is  0.1209\n\n\nThe per-unit monetary measure of brand value between the most-preferred yogurt (Yogurt 1) and the least-preferred yogurt (Yogurt 3) is approximately $0.12 per unit. This means that, in terms of brand value, consumers might be willing to pay an extra 12 cents per unit for Yogurt 1 compared to Yogurt 3, based solely on their preference (utility difference) as captured by the model. This is a useful way to quantify the monetary value of consumer preferences in this context\nOne benefit of the MNL model is that we can simulate counterfactuals (eg, what if the price of yogurt 1 was $0.10/oz instead of $0.08/oz).\nCalculate the market shares in the market at the time the data were collected. Then, increase the price of yogurt 1 by $0.10 and use your fitted model to predict p(y|x) for each consumer and each product (this should be a matrix of \\(N \\times 4\\) estimated choice probabilities). Take the column averages to get the new, expected market shares that result from the $0.10 price increase to yogurt 1. Do the yogurt 1 market shares decrease?\n\n\nCode\n#reload the function cuz the disconnecting between tasks\ndef negative_log_likelihood(beta, X, choices):\n    # Utility calculation\n    utility = X.dot(beta)\n    # Exponentiated utilities\n    exp_util = np.exp(utility)\n    # Sum of exponentiated utilities across choices\n    sum_exp_util = np.sum(exp_util.reshape(-1, 4), axis=1)\n    # Compute choice probabilities\n    probabilities = exp_util / np.repeat(sum_exp_util, 4)\n    # Log of probabilities of chosen alternatives\n    log_likelihood = np.log(probabilities) * choices\n\n    return -np.sum(log_likelihood)\n\n# Prepare the input matrix X and the choice vector\nn_products = 4  # There are 4 products\nfeatures = ['Yogurt1', 'Yogurt2', 'Yogurt3', 'f', 'p']\nX = reshaped_yogurt[features].values\nchoices = reshaped_yogurt['y'].values\n\n# Define initial guesses for the parameters\ninitial_beta = np.zeros(len(features))\n\n# Rerun the optimization with numpy properly imported and initial_beta defined\nresult = minimize(negative_log_likelihood, initial_beta, args=(X, choices))\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndef calculate_probabilities(beta, X):\n    utility = X.dot(beta)\n    exp_util = np.exp(utility)\n    sum_exp_util = np.sum(exp_util.reshape(-1, n_products), axis=1)\n    probabilities = exp_util / np.repeat(sum_exp_util, n_products)\n    return probabilities.reshape(-1, n_products)\n\nestimated_beta = result.x\n# Calculate the initial choice probabilities for all products and all consumers\ninitial_probabilities = calculate_probabilities(estimated_beta, X)\n\n# Calculate the current market shares by taking the mean of probabilities across all consumers for each product\ncurrent_market_shares = np.mean(initial_probabilities, axis=0)\n\n# Display the new market shares\ncurrent_market_shares_df = pd.DataFrame({\n    'Product': ['Yogurt 1', 'Yogurt 2', 'Yogurt 3', 'Yogurt 4'],\n    'Current Market Share': current_market_shares\n})\n\ncurrent_market_shares_df\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduct\nCurrent Market Share\n\n\n\n\n0\nYogurt 1\n0.341975\n\n\n1\nYogurt 2\n0.401235\n\n\n2\nYogurt 3\n0.029218\n\n\n3\nYogurt 4\n0.227572\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe current market shares for the four yogurt products are approximately:\nYogurt 1: 34.2%\nYogurt 2: 40.1%\nYogurt 3: 2.9%\nYogurt 4: 22.8%\nNext, let‚Äôs increase the price of Yogurt 1 by $0.10 and then use the fitted model to predict the new choice probabilities.

This feature is preferred over the baseline of 2ft cargo space, as indicated by the positive coefficient. Consumers prefer more cargo space, all else being equal.\nEngine Hybrid and Electric: Both hybrid and electric engines are less preferred compared to a traditional gas engine, with electric being the least preferred among the options.\nUse the price coefficient as a dollar-per-util conversion factor. We could find the dollar value of 3ft of cargo space as compared to 2ft of cargo space:\n\n\nCode\n # Coefficients from the model results\ncargo_coeff = 0.4385\nprice_coeff = -0.1591\n\n# Calculate the dollar value of having 3ft of cargo space compared to 2ft\ndollar_value_cargo = (cargo_coeff / price_coeff) * (-1)\nprint(\"The Dolla Value of having 3ft cargo space compared to 2ft:\", round(dollar_value_cargo, 3))\n\n\nThe Dolla Value of having 3ft cargo space compared to 2ft: 2.756\n\n\nThe dollar value of having 3 feet of cargo space compared to 2 feet, based on the model, is approximately $2,756. This amount represents the additional value that respondents place on having an extra foot of cargo space in their vehicle choice.\nAssume the market consists of the following 6 minivans.

This minivan has the highest market share, suggesting that consumers highly value the combination of a lower price ($30) with standard features (6 seats, 2ft cargo, gas engine). This option appears to be the most cost-effective and appeals to the majority of consumers.\nMinivan C (31.31%): 8 seats, 2ft cargo, gas engine, $30. This minivan also has a significant market share, indicating that some consumers are willing to opt for a vehicle with more seating capacity at the same price. The additional seats (8 seats) add utility, making it an attractive option despite not being the top choice.\nModerate Market Share Minivan A (11.61%): 7 seats, 2ft cargo, hybrid engine, $30. The hybrid engine in this minivan reduces its market share compared to the purely gas-powered options at the same price point. While hybrid engines are generally valued for their efficiency, the preference in this case seems to be towards conventional gas engines at a lower price.\nLow Market Share Minivan F (5.24%): 7 seats, 2ft cargo, hybrid engine, $35. The increase in price to $35, coupled with similar features as Minivan A, significantly lowers its market share. This suggests that consumers are sensitive to price increases and are less inclined to pay an extra $5 for a similar hybrid vehicle with the same number of seats and cargo space.\nMinivan D (7.84%): 7 seats, 3ft cargo, gas engine, $40. Despite offering more cargo space (3ft), the higher price of $40 detracts from its attractiveness. This indicates that the additional cargo space does not compensate for the higher price for most consumers.\nMinivan E (2.04%): 6 seats, 2ft cargo, electric engine, $40. This minivan has the lowest market share, suggesting that consumers place a relatively low value on electric engines in this context, especially when paired with a high price. The cost does not justify the perceived benefits of the electric engine, resulting in minimal consumer interest.\nKey Takeaways:\nPrice Sensitivity: Consumers show a strong preference for lower-priced options. Minivans priced at $30 dominate the market shares, indicating high price sensitivity.\nEngine Type Preferences: Gas engines are favored over hybrid and electric engines, reflecting either cost concerns or possibly a lack of perceived additional value from alternative engine types at higher prices.\nFeature Trade-offs: Additional features like more seats or cargo space are valued but have a diminishing return when paired with higher prices. Consumers appear to balance their preferences for additional features with their willingness to pay more."

    "text": "1. Estimating Yogurt Preferences\n\nLikelihood for the Multi-nomial Logit (MNL) Model\nSuppose we have \\(i=1,\\ldots,n\\) consumers who each select exactly one product \\(j\\) from a set of \\(J\\) products. The outcome variable is the identity of the product chosen \\(y_i \\in \\{1, \\ldots, J\\}\\) or equivalently a vector of \\(J-1\\) zeros and \\(1\\) one, where the \\(1\\) indicates the selected product. For example, if the third product was chosen out of 4 products, then either \\(y=3\\) or \\(y=(0,0,1,0)\\) depending on how we want to represent it. Suppose also that we have a vector of data on each product \\(x_j\\) (eg, size, price, etc.).\nWe model the consumer‚Äôs decision as the selection of the product that provides the most utility, and we‚Äôll specify the utility function as a linear function of the product characteristics:\n\\[ U_{ij} = x_j'\\beta + \\epsilon_{ij} \\]\nwhere \\(\\epsilon_{ij}\\) is an i.i.d. extreme value error term.\nThe choice of the i.i.d. extreme value error term leads to a closed-form expression for the probability that consumer \\(i\\) chooses product \\(j\\):\n\\[ \\mathbb{P}_i(j) = \\frac{e^{x_j'\\beta}}{\\sum_{k=1}^Je^{x_k'\\beta}} \\]\nFor example, if there are 4 products, the probability that consumer \\(i\\) chooses product 3 is:\n\\[ \\mathbb{P}_i(3) = \\frac{e^{x_3'\\beta}}{e^{x_1'\\beta} + e^{x_2'\\beta} + e^{x_3'\\beta} + e^{x_4'\\beta}} \\]\nA clever way to write the individual likelihood function for consumer \\(i\\) is the product of the \\(J\\) probabilities, each raised to the power of an indicator variable (\\(\\delta_{ij}\\)) that indicates the chosen product:\n\\[ L_i(\\beta) = \\prod_{j=1}^J \\mathbb{P}_i(j)^{\\delta_{ij}} = \\mathbb{P}_i(1)^{\\delta_{i1}} \\times \\ldots \\times \\mathbb{P}_i(J)^{\\delta_{iJ}}\\]\nNotice that if the consumer selected product \\(j=3\\), then \\(\\delta_{i3}=1\\) while \\(\\delta_{i1}=\\delta_{i2}=\\delta_{i4}=0\\) and the likelihood is:\n\\[ L_i(\\beta) = \\mathbb{P}_i(1)^0 \\times \\mathbb{P}_i(2)^0 \\times \\mathbb{P}_i(3)^1 \\times \\mathbb{P}_i(4)^0 = \\mathbb{P}_i(3) = \\frac{e^{x_3'\\beta}}{\\sum_{k=1}^Je^{x_k'\\beta}} \\]\nThe joint likelihood (across all consumers) is the product of the \\(n\\) individual likelihoods:\n\\[ L_n(\\beta) = \\prod_{i=1}^n L_i(\\beta) = \\prod_{i=1}^n \\prod_{j=1}^J \\mathbb{P}_i(j)^{\\delta_{ij}} \\]\nAnd the joint log-likelihood function is:\n\\[ \\ell_n(\\beta) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j=1}^J \\delta_{ij} \\log(\\mathbb{P}_i(j)) \\]\n\n\nYogurt Dataset\nWe will use the yogurt_data dataset, which provides anonymized consumer identifiers (id), a vector indicating the chosen product (y1:y4), a vector indicating if any products were ‚Äúfeatured‚Äù in the store as a form of advertising (f1:f4), and the products‚Äô prices (p1:p4).

This means consumers value Yogurt 1 about $0.12 more per unit than Yogurt 3, based on the estimated utilities. ‚ùó\n\nOne benefit of the MNL model is that we can simulate counterfactuals (eg, what if the price of yogurt 1 was $0.10/oz instead of $0.08/oz).\nCalculating market shares in the market at the time the data were collected.

The intuit75k.parquet file contains data on 75,000 (small) businesses that were selected randomly from the 801,821 that were sent the wave-1 mailing. The mailing contained an offer to upgrade to the latest version of the Quickbooks software.\nVariable res1 denotes which of these businesses responded to the mailing by purchasing Quickbooks version 3.0 from Intuit Direct. Note that Intuit Direct sells products directly to its customers rather than through a retailer. Use the available data to predict which businesses that did not respond to the wave-1 mailing, are most likely to respond to the wave-2 mailing.

If there is scale in the distribution of the variables as exemplified by the histograms produced above, this will effect the ability of our model to accurately and effectively predict the response to our second wave mailing outreach. Based on the distribution of the histograms above, the variable with the greatest skew is the dollars. It skews heavily towards the left, as do the numrods and sincepurch variables. Due to this, we will want to apply some type of transformation to these variables to normalize their distribution.\n\n\nCode\ntrain_data = intuit75k[intuit75k['training'] == 1]\n\n\nHere we are creating our training set of data. This corresponds to any record that has a 1 in the training column within the Intuit75k database. As per the intuit instructions, the data was already pre-split into 70:30 training:test sets. If the data was not pre-split, we would want to consider employing the StratifyShuffleSplit method to create our training and testing data. This would ensure that our training and test sets have the same number of yes‚Äôs, which would provide a more accurate and representative dataset for the training and testing of our model.\n\n\nCode\nintuit75k['res1'].value_counts()\n\n\nres1\nNo     71399\nYes     3601\nName: count, dtype: int64\n\n\n\n\nCorrelation Between Features\nIn addition to scaling the data before we start building our models, we want to identify any potential correlation between the features in our dataset. If any features are highly correlated, this could lead to multi-collinearity within our models and lead to inflation of the variable coefficients or inflated importance of features on our model. If we are able to identify any correlation prior to building our model, we are able to adjust which features are correlated and see how this might increase their importance if a highly-correlated feature is omitted from the model.\n\n\nCode\ncorr_columns = ['zip_bins','bizflag','numords','dollars','last','sincepurch']\ncorr_matrix = train_data[corr_columns].corr()\ncorr_matrix\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nzip_bins\nbizflag\nnumords\ndollars\nlast\nsincepurch\n\n\n\n\nzip_bins\n1.000000\n-0.000679\n0.005397\n0.006667\n-0.000726\n-0.001555\n\n\nbizflag\n-0.000679\n1.000000\n-0.000113\n0.002398\n0.000647\n-0.003839\n\n\nnumords\n0.005397\n-0.000113\n1.000000\n0.587267\n-0.130395\n0.000284\n\n\ndollars\n0.006667\n0.002398\n0.587267\n1.000000\n-0.073897\n0.003649\n\n\nlast\n-0.000726\n0.000647\n-0.130395\n-0.073897\n1.000000\n-0.001506\n\n\nsincepurch\n-0.001555\n-0.003839\n0.000284\n0.003649\n-0.001506\n1.000000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the correlation matrix created above, we see that there is not a high level of correlation between the features of this dataset. A high level of correlation is traditionally considered within the range of 0.7 and 0.9. Correlation coefficients whose magnitude is between 0.5 and 0.7 indicates that variables are moderately correlated. Dollars and numrods have a moderate correlation value of 0.59. It would make sense that these variables have a moderate correlation. The numrod variable represents number of orders from Intuit Direct in the previous 36 months, whereas Dollars represents the total dollar value ordered from intuit direct in the previous 36 months. Traditionally, orders and dollar value tend to have a positive - direct relationship, as we see orders increase, we expect to see dollars increase as well.\n\n\nLogistic Regression Model\nNow that we have transformed the variables to be on the same scale and have identified correlated variables, we can begin building our first logistic regression model. The goal of this model is to predict the probability of a business responding to a mailed offer.\n\n\nCode\n#response rate of the first wave\nresponse_rate = train_data[\"res1_yes\"].mean()\nresponse_rate\n\n\n0.047580952380952383\n\n\nWe can find the average response rate to the first wave mailing offer by taking the mean of the res1_yes column across the training dataset. This will be important when we try to project our model‚Äôs findings onto the larger client base as a whole. This variable represents whether a business responded to the offer or not. The average response rate in the first wave mailing is 4.76%.\n\nLogistic Regression Model 1\n\n\nCode\nlr = rsm.logistic(\n    data = {'wave1': train_data},\n    rvar = \"res1_yes\",\n    evar = [\n        \"zip_bins\",\n        \"bizflag\",\n        \"numords\",\n        \"dollars\",\n        \"last\",\n        \"sincepurch\",\n        \"sex\",\n        \"version1\",\n        \"owntaxprod\",\n        \"upgraded\"\n    ]\n)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nlr.summary(main = True, vif = True)\n\n\nLogistic regression (GLM)\nData                 : wave1\nResponse variable    : res1_yes\nLevel                : None\nExplanatory variables: zip_bins, bizflag, numords, dollars, last, sincepurch, sex, version1, owntaxprod, upgraded\nNull hyp.: There is no effect of x on res1_yes\nAlt. hyp.: There is an effect of x on res1_yes\n\n                 OR     OR%  coefficient  std.error  z.value p.value     \nIntercept     0.052  -94.8%        -2.96      0.087  -34.016  &lt; .001  ***\nsex[Male]     0.987   -1.3%        -0.01      0.052   -0.249   0.804     \nsex[Unknown]  0.991   -0.9%        -0.01      0.074   -0.118   0.906     \nzip_bins      0.946   -5.4%        -0.06      0.004  -14.931  &lt; .001  ***\nbizflag       1.047    4.7%         0.05      0.048    0.964   0.335     \nnumords       1.251   25.1%         0.22      0.019   12.010  &lt; .001  ***\ndollars       1.001    0.1%         0.00      0.000    3.638  &lt; .001  ***\nlast          0.958   -4.2%        -0.04      0.002  -17.959  &lt; .001  ***\nsincepurch    1.002    0.2%         0.00      0.004    0.518   0.605     \nversion1      2.082  108.2%         0.73      0.085    8.583  &lt; .001  ***\nowntaxprod    1.359   35.9%         0.31      0.101    3.048   0.002   **\nupgraded      2.540  154.0%         0.93      0.084   11.076  &lt; .001  ***\n\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\nPseudo R-squared (McFadden): 0.071\nPseudo R-squared (McFadden adjusted): 0.07\nArea under the RO Curve (AUC): 0.709\nLog-likelihood: -9332.061, AIC: 18688.123, BIC: 18794.545\nChi-squared: 1425.521, df(11), p.value &lt; 0.001 \nNr obs: 52,500\n\nVariance inflation factors:\n\n              vif    Rsq\nsincepurch  3.736  0.732\nversion1    2.972  0.664\nupgraded    2.918  0.657\nnumords     1.558  0.358\ndollars     1.527  0.345\nowntaxprod  1.027  0.026\nlast        1.017  0.017\nsex         1.000  0.000\nbizflag     1.000  0.000\nzip_bins    1.000  0.000\n\n\n\nLogistic Regression Summary Interpretation\nBased on the first version of our logistic regression model, there are a couple of important things to note in regards to feature selection and overall performance of the model. First, we want to take a look at our Pseudo R-squared (McFadden) and Pseudo R-squared (McFadden Adjusted) values. Based on our output, we see that these values are 0.073 and 0.07, respectively. The Pseudo R-squared values are generally lower than the traditional R-squared in linear regression models and don‚Äôt have a fixed range. However, the values for our McFadden and McFadden are still on the lower side. This isn‚Äôt automatically a deal-breaker for this model or automatically a reason to throw our model away, but we would want weigh these R-squared values in conjunction with other factors (such as AUC, and Chi-squared) to evaluate the effectiveness and predictive performance of our model. \nIn addition to the r-squared values, we also want to evaluate the AUC value. AUC indicates a model‚Äôs ability to discriminate between a positive and negative class. The AUC value is on a fixed scale, with a base threshold of 0.5. Any value over 0.5 is considered to be a better value, and indicate a better model. Our first logisitic regression model had an AUC of 0.708 which suggests that the model has a good ability to distinguish between the two classes (i.e.¬†responded to the mailing offer or not). We can also use the AIC and BIC values to evaluate our model as well. The AIC and BIC respectively represent the Akaike Information Criterion and the Bayesian Information Criterion. These values also indicate the models‚Äôs fit to the data. Generally, the goal is to have a lower AIC and BIC value, and models with lower AIC and BIC values are preferred. Our model has an AIC value of 18688.123, and the BIC value of 18794.545. These values are a bit difficult to represent or evaluate at first, but will become more important when we begin to omit variables and see how these values change. If both the AIC and BIC values become lower when removing a variable, we would consider using the model that produces the lower values.\nFinally, the most important value when evaluating a models performance is the Chi-squared value. The Chi-squared value of 1425.521 with 11 degrees of freedom and a p.value &lt; 0.001 suggests that the model as a whole is statistically significant, and at least some of the predictors or features in this model are significantly related to the outcome. Therefore, our first logistic regression model with all of the variables included seems to be a statistically significant model with a decent prediction ability. We would want to consider removing any statistically insignificant variables to see how the model‚Äôs performance changes, in hopes of building a more powerful prediction model.\n\n\nCode\nlr.plot(\"vimp\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPermutation Importance Plot Interpretation\nBased on the permutation importance graph above, we can see that the variables of importance are upgraded, last, zip_bins, numrods, version1, owntaxprod, dollars. These variables however, do not contribute to a very large decrease in AUC, but this graph allows us to view the ratio of importance of the variables. Additionally, we can see that the bizflag, sincepurch, and sex variables are not important. Based on their lack of importance via AUC decrease, and their statistical insignificance, as identified by their high p-values in the logistic regression summary, we will consider testing their removal from the model and seeing if the model‚Äôs performance changes.\n\n\nCode\nlr.plot(\"pred\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrediction Plot Interpretation\nBased on the prediction plots above, it looks like gender has very little influence of a prediction value. Similarily bizflag, and since_purch also looks insignificant, and doesn‚Äôt seem to contribute much to the prediction value. Therefore, we will want to remove them from this logistic regression model to see if the new logistic regression improves the AUC and r^2 value.\n\n\nTesting the removal of features from the model\nAs mentioned above, bizflag, sincepurch, and sex all have low importance and are statistically insignificant to our model, as indicated by their high p-values. We want to test removing them from our model to see if the performance of our model changes. The change in model performance will be interpreted based on how the AUC, BIC, Pseudo R-Squared, and Chi-squared values change in comparison to our baseline model with all of the features included as explanatory variables.\n\nRemoving bizflag, sincepurch, and sex together\n\n\nCode\nlr.summary(main = False, test=['sincepurch', 'sex','bizflag'])\n\n\n\nPseudo R-squared (McFadden): 0.071\nPseudo R-squared (McFadden adjusted): 0.07\nArea under the RO Curve (AUC): 0.709\nLog-likelihood: -9332.061, AIC: 18688.123, BIC: 18794.545\nChi-squared: 1425.521, df(11), p.value &lt; 0.001 \nNr obs: 52,500\n\nModel 1: res1_yes ~ zip_bins + numords + dollars + last + version1 + owntaxprod + upgraded\nModel 2: res1_yes ~ zip_bins + bizflag + numords + dollars + last + sincepurch + sex + version1 + owntaxprod + upgraded\nPseudo R-squared, Model 1 vs 2: 0.071 vs 0.071\nChi-squared: 1.257 df (4), p.value 0.869\n\n\n\n\nModel Interpretation\nWe first wanted to see the model‚Äôs performance when we removed sincepurch, sex, and bizflag together from the model. As identified above, we noticed that these variables had the lowest importance to the model and were statistically insignificant to the baseline logistic regression model. The test function enables us to generate a logistic regression output as if we were generating the models without these variables being included. We are then able to compare the model‚Äôs performance with and without them included. As we see, the first output shows our baseline model‚Äôs output. We see the same metrics that were identified previously.\n The second output shows us the Pseudo R-squared values in the baseline logit model vs.¬†our new model with the variables being removed. As we see via the output, the Pseudo r-squared value does not change in model 1 vs.¬†model 2, this indicates that the overall explanatory power of the models is unchanged despite the removal of the sincepurch,sex, and bizflag variables. However, the chi-squared value and the p.value change significantly, which is critical. The chi-squared value of 1.257 with 4 degrees of freedom and a p-value of 0.869 from comparing Model 1 and Model 2 suggests that the variables removed do not significantly contribute to the model. A high p-value (p &gt; 0.05) indicates that there is no significant loss (or gain) in explanatory power due to these changes.\n essentially, the comparison suggests that the removal of bizflag, sincepurch, and sex between Model 1 and Model 2 does not significantly affect the model‚Äôs explanatory power or predictive ability. This is indicated by the unchanged Pseudo R-squared values and the non-significant chi-squared test for the comparison. Therefore, if removing variables does not significantly decrease the model‚Äôs performance, it might be beneficial to keep the model simpler by excluding them. A simpler model is easier to interpret and may generalize better to new data. We will also want to test the removal of the variables one by one to see if that improves the model‚Äôs explanatory power.\n\n\nRemoving sincepurch, and sex\n\n\nCode\nlr.summary(main = False, test = ['sincepurch', 'sex'])\n\n\n\nPseudo R-squared (McFadden): 0.071\nPseudo R-squared (McFadden adjusted): 0.07\nArea under the RO Curve (AUC): 0.709\nLog-likelihood: -9332.061, AIC: 18688.123, BIC: 18794.545\nChi-squared: 1425.521, df(11), p.value &lt; 0.001 \nNr obs: 52,500\n\nModel 1: res1_yes ~ zip_bins + bizflag + numords + dollars + last + version1 + owntaxprod + upgraded\nModel 2: res1_yes ~ zip_bins + bizflag + numords + dollars + last + sincepurch + sex + version1 + owntaxprod + upgraded\nPseudo R-squared, Model 1 vs 2: 0.071 vs 0.071\nChi-squared: 0.331 df (3), p.value 0.954\n\n\n\n\nModel interpretation\nIn the previous section, we evaluated the performance of our logistic regression model when we removed the three insignificant variables from our model as interpreted from their individual p-values. In this removal round, we wanted to evalute the performance of our logistic regression model if we considered removing sincepurch and sex. Both models have the same Pseudo R-squared values (0.071), which suggests that the overall explanatory power of the models is unchanged despite the removal or addition of variables.

The primary difference between the models is the inclusion of owntaxprod in Model 2, which is not present in Model 1. Pseudo R-squared for Model 1 vs.¬†Model 2: 0.071 vs.¬†0.071. This metric provides a measure of the explanatory power of the models, with values closer to 1 indicating a better fit. The identical Pseudo R-squared values for both models suggest that they have the same explanatory power, meaning the addition of owntaxprod in Model 2 does not improve the model‚Äôs ability to explain the variability in the outcome res_yes_no.\nChi-squared: 8.694, df (1), p.value 0.003. This test compares the two models to determine if the addition of the owntaxprod variable in Model 2 significantly improves the model fit compared to Model 1. The chi-squared statistic is used to assess this, with the degrees of freedom (df) typically representing the difference in the number of parameters estimated between the two models. In this case, the df is 1, corresponding to the one additional variable in Model 2. The p-value of 0.003 indicates that the difference in fit between Model 1 and Model 2 is statistically significant at conventional significance levels (e.g., Œ± = 0.05). Therefore, despite the Pseudo R-squared values being identical, the statistical test suggests that owntaxprod provides a significant contribution to predicting the outcome when it is added to the model. \nGiven these results, we would probably want to include owntaxprod in our model. However, some other factors we would want to consider are:\n\n\nModel complexity: Adding more variables can make the model more complex and potentially harder to interpret.\n\n\nPractical significance: Evaluate whether the inclusion of owntaxprod has practical significance in addition to its statistical significance.\n\n\nCross-validation: Perform cross-validation to assess the generalizability of the model and avoid overfitting.\n\n\nFurther evaluation: Consider other metrics such as AUC, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score for a more comprehensive evaluation of model performance, especially in the context of the specific application or decision-making process the model is intended to support.\n\n\n\nCheck cross-validation\n\n\nCode\nct =

segmentation zip_bins, the timing of the last event (last), and the upgrade status (upgraded) are the most influential factors in predicting the yes/no response variable in your Multi-layer Perceptron model. The importance of zip_bins suggests that location-based characteristics are crucial in the model‚Äôs decision-making process. The prominence of last indicates that recent interactions or activities have a significant impact on the predictions, and the positive trend with upgraded implies that customers who have upgraded are more likely to yield a positive response.\n\n\nCode\nclf1.plot(\"pred\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe partial dependence plots show a nuanced view of feature influences. A steeper slope for the zip_bins plot underscores its importance, aligning with the permutation importance results. Other variables like numords, dollars, version1, owntaxprod, and upgraded appear to have a more muted effect on the model‚Äôs output. Overall, the model‚Äôs predictive behavior is mostly swayed by where the customer is located, with other factors playing secondary roles.\nWe wanted to first create a base line neural network model. However, as we can see by the prediction plots, this nn model does not provide much in terms of the predictability based on various variables. We will want to build a neural network with more nodes and more hidden layers, and make our model a bit more flexible.\n\n\nCode\ndct = {\"train\": intuit75k[intuit75k.training == 1], \"test\": intuit75k[intuit75k.training == 0]}\nfig = rsm.gains_plot(dct, \"res1\", \"Yes\", \"pred_nn1\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimate a model with hidden layers sizes: (2, )\n\n\nCode\nclf2 = rsm.model.mlp(\n    data= {'wave1':intuit75k.query('training == 1')},\n    rvar=\"res1_yes\",\n    evar=[\n        'zip_bins',\n        'bizflag',\n        'sex',\n        'sincepurch',\n        'numords',\n        'dollars',\n        'last',\n        'owntaxprod',\n        'version1',\n        'upgraded',\n        'zip801',\n        'zip804'\n    ],\n    hidden_layer_sizes=(2,),\n    mod_type=\"classification\",\n)\nclf2.summary()\n\n\nMulti-layer Perceptron (NN)\nData                 : wave1\nResponse variable    : res1_yes\nLevel                : None\nExplanatory variables: zip_bins, bizflag, sex, sincepurch, numords, dollars, last, owntaxprod, version1, upgraded, zip801, zip804\nModel type           : classification\nNr. of features      : (12, 31)\nNr. of observations  : 52,500\nHidden_layer_sizes   : (2,)\nActivation function  : tanh\nSolver               : lbfgs\nAlpha                : 0.0001\nBatch size           : auto\nLearning rate        : 0.001\nMaximum iterations   : 10000\nrandom_state         : 1234\nAUC                  : 0.777\n\nRaw data             :\nzip_bins  bizflag  sex  sincepurch  numords  dollars  last  owntaxprod  version1  upgraded  zip801  zip804\n      18        0 Male          12        2    109.5     5           0         0         0       0       0\n       1        0 Male           1        1     22.0    17           0         0         0       0       0\n       3        0 Male          17        1     20.0    17           0         0         1       0       0\n      11        1 Male          17        1     24.5     4           0         1         0       0       0\n       5        0 Male           9        3     73.5    10           0         0         0       0       0\n\nEstimation data      :\n bizflag  sincepurch   numords   dollars      last  owntaxprod  version1  upgraded  zip801  zip804  zip_bins_2  zip_bins_3  zip_bins_4  zip_bins_5  zip_bins_6  zip_bins_7  zip_bins_8  zip_bins_9  zip_bins_10  zip_bins_11  zip_bins_12  zip_bins_13  zip_bins_14  zip_bins_15  zip_bins_16  zip_bins_17  zip_bins_18  zip_bins_19  zip_bins_20  sex_Male  sex_Unknown\n       0   -0.360809 -0.057079  0.207902 -1.137183           0         0         0       0       0       False       False       False       False       False       False       False       False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False         True        False        False      True        False\n       0   -1.458194 -0.863720 -0.873735  0.119783           0         0         0       0       0       False       False       False       False       False       False       False       False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False      True        False\n       0    0.138003 -0.863720 -0.898458  0.119783           0         0         1       0       0       False        True       False       False       False       False       False       False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False      True        False\n       1    0.138003 -0.863720 -0.842831 -1.241930           0         1         0       0       0       False       False       False       False       False       False       False       False        False         True        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False      True        False\n       0   -0.660096  0.749561 -0.237115 -0.613447           0         0         0       0       0       False       False       False        True       False       False       False       False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False      True        False\n\n\n\n\nCode\nclf2.plot(\"vimp\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the second neural network model, which now includes two hidden layers with one node each, the permutation importance plot indicates a shift in feature influence. Zip_bins retains its position as the most impactful feature, but upgraded has risen in importance, surpassing last, which was more significant in the first model. This suggests that the model is now giving more weight to the upgrade status of a customer when predicting the outcome. Features like numords and version1 also contribute to the model‚Äôs predictions, but to a lesser extent, while dollars and owntaxprod remain less influential.\n\n\nCode\nclf2.plot(\"pred\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nintuit75k['pred_nn2'] = clf2.predict(intuit75k)['prediction']\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndct = {\"train\": intuit75k[intuit75k.training == 1], \"test\": intuit75k[intuit75k.training == 0]}\nfig = rsm.gains_plot(dct, \"res1\", \"Yes\", \"pred_nn2\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe partial dependence plots offer a more detailed look into the relationships between each feature and the model‚Äôs predictions. The zip_bins plot continues to show that lower bin values are associated with a higher probability of a positive response, reinforcing its top importance. The upgraded feature shows an upward trend, which aligns with its increased importance, suggesting that customers who have upgraded are more likely to have a positive response. Other features, such as numords, last, version1, and owntaxprod, show relatively flat trends, indicating a less significant effect on the prediction. These plots further confirm the model‚Äôs reliance on geographical segmentation and upgrade status, while time since last activity has become relatively less important compared to the first model.\nAs indicated by the prediction plots above, we see that by adding more hidden layers, our neural network become more flexible. However, the flexibility of the model can still be increased, and we will want to consider building an even more flexible model.\n\n\nNeural Network with 1 hidden layer and 3 nodes\n\n\nCode\nclf3 = rsm.model.mlp(\n    data = {'wave1':intuit75k.query('training == 1')},\n    rvar = 'res1_yes',\n    evar = [\n        'zip_bins',\n        'sex',\n        'numords',\n        'bizflag',\n        'dollars',\n        'last',\n        'owntaxprod',\n        'sincepurch',\n        'version1',\n        'upgraded',\n        'zip801',\n        'zip804'\n    ],\n    hidden_layer_sizes = (3,),\n    mod_type = 'classification'\n)\nclf3.summary()\n\n\nMulti-layer Perceptron (NN)\nData                 : wave1\nResponse variable    : res1_yes\nLevel                : None\nExplanatory variables: zip_bins, sex, numords, bizflag, dollars, last, owntaxprod, sincepurch, version1, upgraded, zip801, zip804\nModel type           : classification\nNr. of features      : (12, 31)\nNr. of observations  : 52,500\nHidden_layer_sizes   : (3,)\nActivation function  : tanh\nSolver               : lbfgs\nAlpha                : 0.0001\nBatch size           : auto\nLearning rate        : 0.001\nMaximum iterations   : 10000\nrandom_state         : 1234\nAUC                  : 0.779\n\nRaw data             :\nzip_bins  sex  numords  bizflag  dollars  last  owntaxprod  sincepurch  version1  upgraded  zip801  zip804\n      18 Male        2        0    109.5     5           0          12         0         0       0       0\n       1 Male        1        0     22.0    17           0           1         0         0       0       0\n       3 Male        1        0     20.0    17           0          17         0         1       0       0\n      11 Male        1        1     24.5     4           0          17         1         0       0       0\n       5 Male        3        0     73.5    10           0           9         0         0       0       0\n\nEstimation data      :\n  numords  bizflag   dollars      last  owntaxprod  sincepurch  version1  upgraded  zip801  zip804  zip_bins_2  zip_bins_3  zip_bins_4  zip_bins_5  zip_bins_6  zip_bins_7  zip_bins_8  zip_bins_9  zip_bins_10  zip_bins_11  zip_bins_12  zip_bins_13  zip_bins_14  zip_bins_15  zip_bins_16  zip_bins_17  zip_bins_18  zip_bins_19  zip_bins_20  sex_Male  sex_Unknown\n-0.057079        0  0.207902 -1.137183           0   -0.360809         0         0       0       0       False       False       False       False       False       False       False       False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False         True        False        False      True        False\n-0.863720        0 -0.873735  0.119783           0   -1.458194         0         0       0       0       False       False       False       False       False       False       False       False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False      True        False\n-0.863720        0 -0.898458  0.119783           0    0.138003         0         1       0       0       False        True       False       False       False       False       False       False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False      True        False\n-0.863720        1 -0.842831 -1.241930           0    0.138003         1         0       0       0       False       False       False       False       False       False       False       False        False         True        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False      True        False\n 0.749561        0 -0.237115 -0.613447           0   -0.660096         0         0       0       0       False       False       False        True       False       False       False       False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False      True        False\n\n\n\n\nCode\nclf3.plot('vimp')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the third model, which is a neural network with one hidden layer and three nodes, the permutation importance plot shows a slight rearrangement in feature importance.

The feature upgraded retains substantial importance, affirming its strong predictive power regarding the response variable. Interestingly, version1 has increased in importance compared to the previous models, hinting that the specific version of a product or service is becoming more relevant in the model‚Äôs predictions. Last and numords follow in importance, indicating they are useful but less decisive in influencing the model‚Äôs outcome.\n\n\nCode\nclf3.plot('pred')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe partial dependence plots reveal the following insights:\n\nZip_bins shows a sharp decline, indicating a strong relationship between lower bin values and the likelihood of a positive response.\nThe effect of numords is relatively flat, suggesting a limited influence on the predicted outcome.\nThe last feature shows a downward trend, implying that more recent interactions might correspond to a lower probability of a positive outcome, which is consistent with its position in the permutation importance plot.\nThe upgraded plot has an upward trend, reinforcing its role as an influential predictor, as higher values correlate with a greater likelihood of a positive outcome.\n\nThe consistency of zip_bins and upgraded across all models as top predictors underlines their significance in determining the response variable. The rise of version1 in importance could indicate that the model is beginning to capture more nuanced patterns as the complexity of the network increases. However, features like dollars and owntaxprod remain less impactful, suggesting that they might not be as crucial for the model‚Äôs decision-making process or that their effects are possibly being captured indirectly through interactions with other features.\n\n\nCode\nintuit75k['pred_nn3a'] = clf3.predict(intuit75k)['prediction']\n\n\n\n\nNeural Network with 2 nodes and 10 hidden layers\n\n\nCode\nclf10 = rsm.model.mlp(\n    data = {'wave1':intuit75k.query('training == 1')},\n    rvar = 'res1_yes',\n    evar = [\n        'zip_bins',\n        'sex',\n        'numords',\n        'bizflag',\n        'dollars',\n        'last',\n        'owntaxprod',\n        'sincepurch',\n        'version1',\n        'upgraded',\n        'zip801',\n        'zip804'\n    ],\n    hidden_layer_sizes = (10,10),\n    mod_type = 'classification'\n)\nclf10.summary()\n\n\nMulti-layer Perceptron (NN)\nData                 : wave1\nResponse variable    : res1_yes\nLevel                : None\nExplanatory variables: zip_bins, sex, numords, bizflag, dollars, last, owntaxprod, sincepurch, version1, upgraded, zip801, zip804\nModel type           : classification\nNr. of features      : (12, 31)\nNr. of observations  : 52,500\nHidden_layer_sizes   : (10, 10)\nActivation function  : tanh\nSolver               : lbfgs\nAlpha                : 0.0001\nBatch size           : auto\nLearning rate        : 0.001\nMaximum iterations   : 10000\nrandom_state         : 1234\nAUC                  : 0.838\n\nRaw data             :\nzip_bins  sex  numords  bizflag  dollars  last  owntaxprod  sincepurch  version1  upgraded  zip801  zip804\n      18 Male        2        0    109.5     5           0          12         0         0       0       0\n       1 Male        1        0     22.0    17           0           1         0         0       0       0\n       3 Male        1        0     20.0    17           0          17         0         1       0       0\n      11 Male        1        1     24.5     4           0          17         1         0       0       0\n       5 Male        3        0     73.5    10           0           9         0         0       0       0\n\nEstimation data      :\n  numords  bizflag   dollars      last  owntaxprod  sincepurch  version1  upgraded  zip801  zip804  zip_bins_2  zip_bins_3  zip_bins_4  zip_bins_5  zip_bins_6  zip_bins_7  zip_bins_8  zip_bins_9  zip_bins_10  zip_bins_11  zip_bins_12  zip_bins_13  zip_bins_14  zip_bins_15  zip_bins_16  zip_bins_17  zip_bins_18  zip_bins_19  zip_bins_20  sex_Male  sex_Unknown\n-0.057079        0  0.207902 -1.137183           0   -0.360809         0         0       0       0       False       False       False       False       False       False       False       False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False         True        False        False      True        False\n-0.863720        0 -0.873735  0.119783           0   -1.458194         0         0       0       0       False       False       False       False       False       False       False       False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False      True        False\n-0.863720        0 -0.898458  0.119783           0    0.138003         0         1       0       0       False        True       False       False       False       False       False       False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False      True        False\n-0.863720        1 -0.842831 -1.241930           0    0.138003         1         0       0       0       False       False       False       False       False       False       False       False        False         True        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False      True        False\n 0.749561        0 -0.237115 -0.613447           0   -0.660096         0         0       0       0       False       False       False        True       False       False       False       False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False      True        False\n\n\n\n\nCode\nclf10.plot('vimp')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nclf10.plot('pred')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nintuit75k['pred_nn10'] = clf10.predict(intuit75k)['prediction']\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndct = {\"train\": intuit75k[intuit75k.training == 1], \"test\": intuit75k[intuit75k.training == 0]}\nfig = rsm.gains_plot(dct, \"res1\", \"Yes\", \"pred_nn10\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the latest neural network model with two nodes in each of ten hidden layers, the summary and permutation importance plot provide insights into its learning process. This more complex model architecture did not converge, which suggests that the optimization algorithm (likely L-BFGS) was unable to find a solution that minimally satisfies the problem constraints within the iteration limit. This might be due to an insufficient number of iterations, a need for better scaling of input data, or an overly complex model for the given data.\nThe permutation importance plot for this non-converged model indicates that zip_bins remains the most critical feature, followed by upgraded and last, which is consistent with previous models. This underscores the model‚Äôs reliance on geographic data, upgrade status, and recent activity as key determinants of the predicted outcome. Other features such as numords, version1, and dollars continue to be relevant, but their impact on the model‚Äôs predictions is less pronounced.\nWithout convergence, however, the reliability of these importance scores might be compromised. It‚Äôs also important to note that without a properly converged model, any interpretation of the feature importances and relationships should be taken with caution. Adjusting the model‚Äôs parameters or preprocessing the input data could help achieve convergence and provide more reliable insights into the importance and effects of different features on the model‚Äôs predictions."

The chart plots the percentage of positive outcomes (buyers) captured against the percentage of the population targeted based on the model‚Äôs predictions.\nAll models perform above the diagonal line, which represents random chance; this indicates that each model has predictive power beyond mere guessing. The chart shows that the logistic regression and the first neural network model (pred_nn1) have similar performance, capturing nearly the same percentage of buyers across the population targeted. The second neural network model (pred_nn2) appears to perform slightly better, capturing a marginally higher percentage of buyers for most of the population percentages targeted. This suggests that pred_nn2 may have a more nuanced understanding of the data, possibly due to a more complex model structure, and is able to more accurately identify potential buyers.\nHowever, the differences between the models are not drastic, which implies that the complexity added in the neural network models may not be translating into significantly better performance over the logistic regression in this case. The closeness of their performances also suggests that the relationships within the data might be captured almost as effectively by the simpler logistic regression model as by the more complex neural network models.\n\n\nCode\ndct = {\"train\": intuit75k[intuit75k.training == 1], \"test\": intuit75k[intuit75k.training == 0]}\nfig = rsm.gains_plot(dct, \"res1\", \"Yes\", [\"pred_logit\"])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth the training and test curves lie above the diagonal, indicating that the logistic regression model has learned to identify buyers more effectively than random chance. The closeness of the two lines suggests that the model generalizes well; it performs similarly on both the training data (seen data) and the test data (unseen data). This is indicative of a good model fit without overfitting, as overfitting would typically be revealed by a high performance on the training data but a significantly lower performance on the test data.\nThe chart shows that as you target more of the population based on the model‚Äôs predictions, you capture a higher percentage of buyers. Both lines show a relatively steady and linear increase, suggesting that the model ranks potential buyers effectively across the entire dataset. There‚Äôs no sharp increase at the beginning, which would suggest that there‚Äôs a subset of the population with a significantly higher likelihood of buying. Instead, the model‚Äôs predictions are spread out across the population, capturing buyers at a fairly uniform rate as more of the population is targeted.\n\n\nCode\nfig = rsm.gains_plot(dct, \"res1\", \"Yes\", \"pred_nn0\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nfig = rsm.gains_plot(dct, \"res1\", \"Yes\", \"pred_nn1\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nfig = rsm.gains_plot(dct, \"res1\", \"Yes\", \"pred_nn2\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis gains chart displays the performance of the second neural network model (pred_nn2) on both the training and test datasets. The chart demonstrates that the model is effective at identifying buyers, as indicated by the curves lying well above the diagonal line representing random selection.\nThe performance on the training data is very close to the performance on the test data, which suggests that the model generalizes well and is not overfitting. Overfitting would be indicated by a high performance on the training data but significantly worse performance on the test data. The fact that both curves are almost superimposed on each other indicates that the patterns the model has learned from the training data are applicable to the unseen test data.\nAdditionally, the curves are steeper at the beginning, which means that targeting a smaller percentage of the population based on the model‚Äôs predictions can capture a larger percentage of buyers. This is a desirable trait in a model used for prioritizing which segments of a population to target for marketing or intervention efforts. The model seems to rank potential buyers effectively, identifying those most likely to purchase early on as the population is targeted incrementally. This can be particularly valuable in applications where it is cost-effective to target only a subset of the entire population."

This insight into human behavior suggests that the strategy employed to encourage donations in the treatment group was effective in increasing donation rates.\nIn other words, if the experiment involved sending out letters asking for donations, and the treatment group received letters with a special message or offer not given to the control group, we could interpret these results to mean that the special message or offer motivated more people to donate. The important takeaway here is that small changes in how we ask for donations can have a significant impact on people‚Äôs willingness to contribute to a cause.

It suggests that the actual ratio, rather than the ease of achieving a match, motivates donors\nContradiction of the statement: The significant effects effects observed at higher match ratios contradict any implication the match ratios do not influence donor behavior.

Smaller standard errors indicate more precise estimates. In this table, the standard errors for the treatment levels are the same (0.002), suggesting similar levels of precision across these estimates.\nThe results indicate that only the 2:1 and 3:1 match ratios significantly increase the likelihood of donations compared to the control group at the 95% confidence level. The effects of these higher match ratios are robust, suggesting that they are effective strategies for increasing donation rates.\nThe 1:1 match ratio, while showing a positive effect, does not reach the threshold for statistical significance at this confidence level. This implies that while there might be a slight increase in donation likelihood with a 1:1 match, the evidence is not strong enough to conclusively state this at the 95% confidence level.\n\n\nResponse rate difference\n\n\nCode\nrr_1_1 = data[data['ratio1'] == 1]['gave'].mean()\nrr_2_1 = data[data['ratio2'] == 1]['gave'].mean()\nrr_3_1 = data[data['ratio3'] == 1]['gave'].mean()\n\nrr_diff_11_vs_21 = rr_2_1 - rr_1_1\nrr_diff_21_vs_31 = rr_3_1 - rr_2_1\n\nprint(f'The response rate difference between the 1:1 and 2:1 match ratios {round(rr_diff_11_vs_21, 3)}')\nprint(f'The response rate difference between the 2:1 and 3:1 match ratios {round(rr_diff_21_vs_31, 3)}')\n\n\nThe response rate difference between the 1:1 and 2:1 match ratios 0.002\nThe response rate difference between the 2:1 and 3:1 match ratios 0.0\n\n\nRecall the linear regression result above:\n\n\nCode\nlr.coef.round(3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nindex\ncoefficient\nstd.error\nt.value\np.value\n\n\n\n\n\n0\nIntercept\n0.018\n0.001\n16.225\n0.000\n***\n\n\n1\nratio1\n0.003\n0.002\n1.661\n0.097\n.\n\n\n2\nratio2\n0.005\n0.002\n2.744\n0.006\n**\n\n\n3\nratio3\n0.005\n0.002\n2.802\n0.005\n**\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ncoef_ratio1 = 0.003\ncoef_ratio2 = 0.005\ncoef_ratio3 = 0.005\n\ncoef_11_vs_21 = coef_ratio2 - coef_ratio1\ncoef_21_vs_31 = coef_ratio3 - coef_ratio2\n\nprint(f'The response rate difference between the 1:1 and 2:1 match ratios from regression is {round(coef_11_vs_21, 3)}')\nprint(f'The response rate difference between the 2:1 and 3:1 match ratios from regression is {round(coef_21_vs_31, 3)}')\n\n\nThe response rate difference between the 1:1 and 2:1 match ratios from regression is 0.002\nThe response rate difference between the 2:1 and 3:1 match ratios from regression is 0.0\n\n\n1:1 vs 2:1 : The very small difference (0.002) suggests only a marginal improvement in the response rate from the 1:1 and 2:1 match ratio. This indicates that while the 2:1 match ratio might be slightly more effective than 1:1, the difference is minimal\n2:1 vs 3:1 The zero difference suggest that there is no additional benefit in increasing the match ratio from 2:1 to 3:1 regarding the likelihood of donations. This suggests diminishing returns when the match ratio increase beyond 2:1\nThese findings imply that while increasing the match ratio from 1:1 to 2:1 might offer a slight increase in donation likelihood, increasing it further to 3:1 does not yield additional benefits. This could be crucial for organizations in deciding how aggressively to pursue higher matching ratios in their fundraising strategies. The minimal differences suggest that other factors may be more critical in influencing donation behavior than merely adjusting the match ratio."

This p-value is slightly above the conventional threshold of 0.05, indicating that the difference in average donation amounts between the treatment and control groups is not statistically significant at the 5% level. However, the p-value is close to the threshold, suggesting a potential trend where the treatment group might have higher donation amounts than the control group, though this difference isn‚Äôt strong enough to be considered statistically significant.\n\nLinear Regression\n\n\nCode\nlr = rsm.model.regress(\n    data = data,\n    rvar = 'amount',\n    evar = 'treatment'\n)\nlr.coef.round(3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nindex\ncoefficient\nstd.error\nt.value\np.value\n\n\n\n\n\n0\nIntercept\n0.813\n0.067\n12.063\n0.000\n***\n\n\n1\ntreatment\n0.154\n0.083\n1.861\n0.063\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinear Regression Results:\nIntercept: 0.8133\nThis suggests that the average donation amount for the control group is approximately 0.813 units.\nCoefficient for Treatment: 0.154\nThis indicates that being in the treatment group is associated with an increase in the donation amount by approximately 0.154 units compared to the control group.\nP-Value for Treatment: 0.063\nThe p-value is slightly above the conventional threshold of 0.05, indicating that the effect of treatment on donation amount is not statistically significant at the 5% level. However, it‚Äôs close, suggesting a potential positive impact of the treatment on donation amounts.\nOverall Interpretation: Both the t-test and the linear regression suggest that the treatment might have a slight positive effect on donation amounts, but this effect does not reach statistical significance. This could imply that while the treatment potentially influences donations positively, the effect is not large or consistent enough across the sample to conclude definitively about its effectiveness. It‚Äôs also possible that other variables not considered here could be influencing the donations, and including those in the model could potentially change these results.\n\n\nLimit only those who made a donation:\n\n\nCode\ndata_donated = data[data['amount'] &gt; 0]\n\n\n\nT-Test\n\n\nCode\ndonated_treatment = data_donated.loc[data_donated['treatment'] == 1,'amount']\ndonated_control = data_donated.loc[data_donated['treatment'] == 0,'amount']\n\n# Apply the t_values function that we defined above\nt_value_donated = t_value(donated_treatment, donated_control)\nprint(f\"T_value is {t_value_donated}\")\n\n\nT_value is -0.5846089783693985\n\n\n\n\nCode\n#Apply the degree of freedom funcion that we defined above\ndof_donated = dof(donated_treatment, donated_control)\nprint(f\"Degree of freedom is {dof_donated}\")\n\n\nDegree of freedom is 557.4599283248195\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Find p-value\np_value = t.cdf(t_value_donated, dof_donated)*2\nprint(f\"P_value is {p_value}\")\n\n\nP_value is 0.5590471873269819\n\n\nThe t-statistic of -0.5846 suggests a lower average donation amount in the treatment group compared to the control group among donors, though the difference is minor.\nThe p-value of 0.559 indicates that this difference is not statistically significant. This means we do not have sufficient evidence to conclude that the treatment affects donation amounts among those who donate.\n\n\nLinear Regression\n\n\nCode\nlr = rsm.model.regress(\n    data = data_donated,\n    rvar = 'amount',\n    evar = 'treatment'\n)\nlr.coef.round(3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nindex\ncoefficient\nstd.error\nt.value\np.value\n\n\n\n\n\n0\nIntercept\n45.540\n2.423\n18.792\n0.000\n***\n\n\n1\ntreatment\n-1.668\n2.872\n-0.581\n0.561\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTreatment Coefficient: The coefficient for the treatment group is approximately -1.67 with a standard error of about 2.87. This suggests that, on average, the treatment group donated about 1.67 units less than the control group among those who donated.\nStatistical Significance: P-value for the Treatment: The p-value for the treatment effect is 0.561, which is not statistically significant. This implies that there is no strong evidence to suggest that the treatment effect differs from zero in the population of donors.\nThe negatice coefficient for the treatment group suggests that the treatment potentially lead to a decrease in the amount donated compared to the control group among those who donated. However, the lack of statistical significance (p-value &gt; 0.05) means we can not confidently assert that this treatment effect is different from zero in the broader donor population.\nCausal Interpretation:\nWhether the treatment coefficient can be interpreted causally depends on how the treatment was assigned. If the treatment was randomly assigned to participants, then the coefficient could potentially have a causal interpretation. Random assignment would help control for both observed and unobserved confounding variables, allowing us to attribute differences in outcomes directly to the treatment effect.\nWhat Did We Learn?\nThe analysis indicates that among those who chose to donate, the treatment did not significantly increase donation amounts. In fact, the point estimate suggests a slight decrease in donations, but this result is not statistically significant. This finding helps understand the treatment‚Äôs impact specifically on the subset of the population that decides to donate, complementing the broader analysis which includes non-donors.\n\n\nPlots\n\n\nCode\n# Prepare the plots for treatment and control groups who made donations\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=1, ncols=2, figsize=(14, 6))\n\n# Plot for Treatment Group\naxes[0].hist(donated_treatment, bins=30, color='blue', alpha=0.7)\naxes[0].axvline(donated_treatment.mean(), color='red', linestyle='dashed', linewidth=1)\naxes[0].set_title('Treatment Group Donation Amounts')\naxes[0].set_xlabel('Donation Amount')\naxes[0].set_ylabel('Frequency')\naxes[0].text(donated_treatment.mean(), max(axes[0].get_ylim()) * 0.5, f'Average: {donated_treatment.mean():.2f}', color='red')\n\n# Plot for Control Group\naxes[1].hist(donated_control, bins=30, color='green', alpha=0.7)\naxes[1].axvline(donated_control.mean(), color='red', linestyle='dashed', linewidth=1)\naxes[1].set_title('Control Group Donation Amounts')\naxes[1].set_xlabel('Donation Amount')\naxes[1].set_ylabel('Frequency')\naxes[1].text(donated_control.mean(), max(axes[1].get_ylim()) * 0.5, f'Average: {donated_control.mean():.2f}', color='red')\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTreatment Group Donation Amounts:\nThe majority of donations are concentrated in the lower range of amounts, with the frequency decreasing as the amount increases.\nThere‚Äôs a significant frequency at the lowest amount, indicating that many donations are of a small value.\nThe average donation amount in the treatment group is indicated by a vertical dotted red line and is annotated as $43.87.\nControl Group Donation Amounts:\nSimilar to the treatment group, most donations are of a lower amount, with frequency tapering off for higher donation amounts.\nThe distribution of donations appears slightly more spread out than the treatment group, with some higher amounts being more frequent compared to the treatment group.\nThe average donation amount for the control group is slightly higher than the treatment group, marked by a vertical dotted red line, at $45.54.\nInterpretation:\n\nThe control group has a slightly higher average donation amount compared to the treatment group.\nBoth histograms appear right-skewed, which is common in financial data since a large number of small donations are often accompanied by a smaller number of much larger donations"

The differences are calculated for each trial as the outcome of the treatment minus the outcome of the control.\nRed dashed line: This line marks the true difference in means between the probabilities of making a donation in the treatment and control groups, which is p_treatment - p_control = 0.022 - 0.018 = 0.004.\n\nObservations from the plot\nThe blue line, or the cumulative average of differences, fluctuates initially but starts to stabilize and approach the red dashed line as the number of trials increases. This behavior exemplifies the Law of Large Numbers, which states that as the number of trials increases, the sample average will converge to the expected value (in this case, the true difference in means).\nThe plot confirms that with a sufficient number of trials, the cumulative average of the differences in donation behavior between the treatment and control groups approaches the true difference in means. This simulation reinforces our understanding of statistical concepts like the Law of Large Numbers and provides a visual affirmation that with enough data, our estimates can reliably approximate true population parameters. This also supports the validity of using such statistical methods to evaluate the effects of interventions like charitable donation matches\n\n\nCentral Limit Theorem\n\n\nCode\n# Define sample sizes to simulate\nsample_sizes = [50, 200, 500, 1000]\n\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=1, ncols=4, figsize=(20, 5), sharey=True)\n\n# Simulate the process and plot the histograms\nfor i, sample_size in enumerate(sample_sizes):\n    # Simulate drawing samples and calculating the means 1000 times\n    sample_means = np.array([np.mean(np.random.binomial(1, p_treatment, sample_size) - \n                                     np.random.binomial(1, p_control, sample_size)) \n                             for _ in range(1000)])\n    \n    # Plot the histogram\n    axes[i].hist(sample_means, bins=30, orientation='horizontal', color='blue', alpha=0.6, edgecolor='black')\n    \n    # Calculate the mean and standard deviation for the normal distribution curve\n    mean_of_sample_means = np.mean(sample_means)\n    std_dev_of_sample_means = np.std(sample_means)\n\n    # Generate values for the normal distribution curve\n    curve_x = np.linspace(mean_of_sample_means - 3 * std_dev_of_sample_means, \n                          mean_of_sample_means + 3 * std_dev_of_sample_means, 100)\n    curve_y = (1 / (std_dev_of_sample_means * np.sqrt(2 * np.pi)) *\n               np.exp(-(curve_x - mean_of_sample_means) ** 2 / (2 * std_dev_of_sample_means ** 2)))\n    \n    # Scale the curve y to match the histogram scale\n    curve_y_scaled = curve_y * max(np.histogram(sample_means, bins=30)[0]) / max(curve_y)\n    \n    # Draw the normal distribution curve as a red line\n    axes[i].plot(curve_y_scaled, curve_x, '-')\n\n    # Add a red dashed line at the true difference\n    axes[i].axhline(y=0.004, color='red', linestyle='dashed', linewidth=2)\n\n    # Set titles and labels\n    axes[i].set_title(f'Sample Size {sample_size}')\n    axes[i].set_xlabel('Frequency' if i == len(sample_sizes) - 1 else '')  # Only add xlabel to the last subplot\n    axes[i].set_ylabel('Average Difference' if i == 0 else '')  # Only add ylabel to the first subplot\n\n# Adjust layout for better fit\nplt.tight_layout()\n\n# Show the plot\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we can see:\nSample Size 50: There is considerable variability around the true difference, indicating that smaller sample sizes can produce estimates that fluctuate widely.\nSample Size 200: The histogram becomes tighter around the true difference, with less variability than the sample size of 50.\nSample Size 500: Further reduction in variability is observed, and the distribution of averages is centered closely around the true difference.\nSample Size 1000: This histogram shows the least variability, and the average differences are clustering tightly around the true difference, with the center of the distribution aligning closely with the red line.\nLaw of Large Numbers: As the sample size increases, the cumulative average difference becomes more consistent and stable around the true difference. This is a demonstration of the Law of Large Numbers‚Äîthe sample averages converge to the expected value as the sample size grows.\nCentral Limit Theorem: As the sample size increases, the distribution of sample means (average differences in this case) becomes more symmetrical and bell-shaped, which is evidence of the Central Limit Theorem in action. The sample means for larger sample sizes tend to form a normal distribution centered around the true population mean.\nZero in the Distribution: In all histograms, the zero mark is not in the middle of the distribution; it‚Äôs in the left tail. This is because the treatment group has a higher probability of donating than the control group (0.022 vs.¬†0.018), so the true difference is expected to be positive (0.004), not zero."

    "text": "1. Estimating Yogurt Preferences\n\nLikelihood for the Multi-nomial Logit (MNL) Model\nSuppose we have \\(i=1,\\ldots,n\\) consumers who each select exactly one product \\(j\\) from a set of \\(J\\) products. The outcome variable is the identity of the product chosen \\(y_i \\in \\{1, \\ldots, J\\}\\) or equivalently a vector of \\(J-1\\) zeros and \\(1\\) one, where the \\(1\\) indicates the selected product. For example, if the third product was chosen out of 4 products, then either \\(y=3\\) or \\(y=(0,0,1,0)\\) depending on how we want to represent it. Suppose also that we have a vector of data on each product \\(x_j\\) (eg, size, price, etc.).\nWe model the consumer‚Äôs decision as the selection of the product that provides the most utility, and we‚Äôll specify the utility function as a linear function of the product characteristics:\n\\[ U_{ij} = x_j'\\beta + \\epsilon_{ij} \\]\nwhere \\(\\epsilon_{ij}\\) is an i.i.d. extreme value error term.\nThe choice of the i.i.d. extreme value error term leads to a closed-form expression for the probability that consumer \\(i\\) chooses product \\(j\\):\n\\[ \\mathbb{P}_i(j) = \\frac{e^{x_j'\\beta}}{\\sum_{k=1}^Je^{x_k'\\beta}} \\]\nFor example, if there are 4 products, the probability that consumer \\(i\\) chooses product 3 is:\n\\[ \\mathbb{P}_i(3) = \\frac{e^{x_3'\\beta}}{e^{x_1'\\beta} + e^{x_2'\\beta} + e^{x_3'\\beta} + e^{x_4'\\beta}} \\]\nA clever way to write the individual likelihood function for consumer \\(i\\) is the product of the \\(J\\) probabilities, each raised to the power of an indicator variable (\\(\\delta_{ij}\\)) that indicates the chosen product:\n\\[ L_i(\\beta) = \\prod_{j=1}^J \\mathbb{P}_i(j)^{\\delta_{ij}} = \\mathbb{P}_i(1)^{\\delta_{i1}} \\times \\ldots \\times \\mathbb{P}_i(J)^{\\delta_{iJ}}\\]\nNotice that if the consumer selected product \\(j=3\\), then \\(\\delta_{i3}=1\\) while \\(\\delta_{i1}=\\delta_{i2}=\\delta_{i4}=0\\) and the likelihood is:\n\\[ L_i(\\beta) = \\mathbb{P}_i(1)^0 \\times \\mathbb{P}_i(2)^0 \\times \\mathbb{P}_i(3)^1 \\times \\mathbb{P}_i(4)^0 = \\mathbb{P}_i(3) = \\frac{e^{x_3'\\beta}}{\\sum_{k=1}^Je^{x_k'\\beta}} \\]\nThe joint likelihood (across all consumers) is the product of the \\(n\\) individual likelihoods:\n\\[ L_n(\\beta) = \\prod_{i=1}^n L_i(\\beta) = \\prod_{i=1}^n \\prod_{j=1}^J \\mathbb{P}_i(j)^{\\delta_{ij}} \\]\nAnd the joint log-likelihood function is:\n\\[ \\ell_n(\\beta) = \\sum_{i=1}^n \\sum_{j=1}^J \\delta_{ij} \\log(\\mathbb{P}_i(j)) \\]\n\n\nYogurt Dataset\nWe will use the yogurt_data dataset, which provides anonymized consumer identifiers (id), a vector indicating the chosen product (y1:y4), a vector indicating if any products were ‚Äúfeatured‚Äù in the store as a form of advertising (f1:f4), and the products‚Äô prices (p1:p4). For example, consumer 1 purchased yogurt 4 at a price of 0.079/oz and none of the yogurts were featured/advertised at the time of consumer 1‚Äôs purchase. Consumers 2 through 7 each bought yogurt 2, etc.\n\nData Overview\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable Definitions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nid\nanonymized consumer identifiers.\n\n\ny1, y2, y3, y4\na vector indicating the chosen product.\n\n\nf1, f2, f3, f4\na vector indicating if any products were ‚Äúfeatured‚Äù in the store as a form of advertising\n\n\np1, p2, p3, p4\nthe products‚Äô prices\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nyogurt_data = pd.read_csv('yogurt_data.csv')\nyogurt_data.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid\ny1\ny2\ny3\ny4\nf1\nf2\nf3\nf4\np1\np2\np3\np4\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0.108\n0.081\n0.061\n0.079\n\n\n1\n2\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0.108\n0.098\n0.064\n0.075\n\n\n2\n3\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0.108\n0.098\n0.061\n0.086\n\n\n3\n4\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0.108\n0.098\n0.061\n0.086\n\n\n4\n5\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0.125\n0.098\n0.049\n0.079\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nyogurt_data.describe(include='all')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid\ny1\ny2\ny3\ny4\nf1\nf2\nf3\nf4\np1\np2\np3\np4\n\n\n\n\ncount\n2430.0000\n2430.000000\n2430.000000\n2430.000000\n2430.000000\n2430.000000\n2430.000000\n2430.000000\n2430.000000\n2430.000000\n2430.000000\n2430.000000\n2430.000000\n\n\nmean\n1215.5000\n0.341975\n0.401235\n0.029218\n0.227572\n0.055556\n0.039506\n0.037449\n0.037449\n0.106248\n0.081532\n0.053622\n0.079507\n\n\nstd\n701.6249\n0.474469\n0.490249\n0.168452\n0.419351\n0.229109\n0.194836\n0.189897\n0.189897\n0.020587\n0.011047\n0.008054\n0.007714\n\n\nmin\n1.0000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n-0.012000\n0.000000\n0.025000\n0.004000\n\n\n25%\n608.2500\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.103000\n0.081000\n0.050000\n0.079000\n\n\n50%\n1215.5000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.108000\n0.086000\n0.054000\n0.079000\n\n\n75%\n1822.7500\n1.000000\n1.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.115000\n0.086000\n0.061000\n0.086000\n\n\nmax\n2430.0000\n1.000000\n1.000000\n1.000000\n1.000000\n1.000000\n1.000000\n1.000000\n1.000000\n0.193000\n0.111000\n0.086000\n0.104000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatistics Summary:\n\nThere are 2,430 records.\nBinary fields (y1, y2, y3, y4, f1, f2, f3, f4) indicate varying levels of frequency with which different yogurts were chosen or conditions were met.\nPrice or index fields (p1, p2, p3, p4) show distributions with differing means, minima, and maxima, suggesting variability in yogurt pricing or attributes across the samples.\n\nLet the vector of product features include brand dummy variables for yogurts 1-3 (we‚Äôll omit a dummy for product 4 to avoid multi-collinearity), a dummy variable to indicate if a yogurt was featured, and a continuous variable for the yogurts‚Äô prices:\n\\[\nx_j' = \\left[ \\mathbb{1}(\\text{Yogurt 1}), \\mathbb{1}(\\text{Yogurt 2}), \\mathbb{1}(\\text{Yogurt 3}), X_f, X_p \\right]\n\\]\nThe ‚Äúhard part‚Äù of the MNL likelihood function is organizing the data, as we need to keep track of 3 dimensions (consumer \\(i\\), covariate \\(k\\), and product \\(j\\)) instead of the typical 2 dimensions for cross-sectional regression models (consumer \\(i\\) and covariate \\(k\\)).\nWhat we would like to do is reorganize the data from a ‚Äúwide‚Äù shape with \\(n\\) rows and multiple columns for each covariate, to a ‚Äúlong‚Äù shape with \\(n \\times J\\) rows and a single column for each covariate.

Here‚Äôs how to interpret these intercepts in the context of consumer preferences:\n\\(\\beta_1\\) (Yogurt 1): The positive and highest value among the three suggests that Yogurt 1 is the most preferred when no other attributes (like price or features) are considered. It has the highest intrinsic utility.\n\\(\\beta_2\\) (Yogurt 2): This is also positive but lower than \\(\\beta_1\\) , indicating that Yogurt 2 is less preferred than Yogurt 1 but still has a positive intrinsic appeal compared to a baseline (which could be another product not included in these three, like Yogurt 4 in this analysis).\n\\(\\beta_3\\) (Yogurt 3): The negative value here suggests that Yogurt 3 is least preferred among the three, having a lower intrinsic utility relative to the others.\nGiven these interpretations, Yogurt 1 appears to be the most preferred option among the first three, followed by Yogurt 2, with Yogurt 3 being the least preferred under the assumption that other factors are equal. This intrinsic preference could be driven by factors not explicitly modeled but captured by the intercepts, such as brand affinity, flavor preferences, or other unobserved attributes associated with each product.\nUse the estimated price coefficient as a dollar-per-util conversion factor. Use this conversion factor to calculate the dollar benefit between the most-preferred yogurt (the one with the highest intercept) and the least preferred yogurt (the one with the lowest intercept). This is a per-unit monetary measure of brand value.\n\n\nCode\n# Extracted beta values for Yogurt 1 and Yogurt 3 and the price coefficient\nbeta_1 = 1.39\nbeta_3 = -3.09\nbeta_p = -37.06  # The negative price coefficient\n\n# Calculate utility difference\nutility_difference = beta_1 - beta_3\n\n# Convert utility difference to dollar benefit using the price coefficient\ndollar_benefit = utility_difference / abs(beta_p)\n\nprint(\"Per-unit monetary measure of brand value is \", round(dollar_benefit, 4))\n\n\nPer-unit monetary measure of brand value is  0.1209\n\n\nThe per-unit monetary measure of brand value between the most-preferred yogurt (Yogurt 1) and the least-preferred yogurt (Yogurt 3) is approximately $0.12 per unit. This means that, in terms of brand value, consumers might be willing to pay an extra 12 cents per unit for Yogurt 1 compared to Yogurt 3, based solely on their preference (utility difference) as captured by the model. This is a useful way to quantify the monetary value of consumer preferences in this context\nOne benefit of the MNL model is that we can simulate counterfactuals (eg, what if the price of yogurt 1 was $0.10/oz instead of $0.08/oz).\nCalculate the market shares in the market at the time the data were collected. Then, increase the price of yogurt 1 by $0.10 and use your fitted model to predict p(y|x) for each consumer and each product (this should be a matrix of \\(N \\times 4\\) estimated choice probabilities). Take the column averages to get the new, expected market shares that result from the $0.10 price increase to yogurt 1. Do the yogurt 1 market shares decrease?\n\n\nCode\n#reload the function cuz the disconnecting between tasks\ndef negative_log_likelihood(beta, X, choices):\n    # Utility calculation\n    utility = X.dot(beta)\n    # Exponentiated utilities\n    exp_util = np.exp(utility)\n    # Sum of exponentiated utilities across choices\n    sum_exp_util = np.sum(exp_util.reshape(-1, 4), axis=1)\n    # Compute choice probabilities\n    probabilities = exp_util / np.repeat(sum_exp_util, 4)\n    # Log of probabilities of chosen alternatives\n    log_likelihood = np.log(probabilities) * choices\n\n    return -np.sum(log_likelihood)\n\n# Prepare the input matrix X and the choice vector\nn_products = 4  # There are 4 products\nfeatures = ['Yogurt1', 'Yogurt2', 'Yogurt3', 'f', 'p']\nX = reshaped_yogurt[features].values\nchoices = reshaped_yogurt['y'].values\n\n# Define initial guesses for the parameters\ninitial_beta = np.zeros(len(features))\n\n# Rerun the optimization with numpy properly imported and initial_beta defined\nresult = minimize(negative_log_likelihood, initial_beta, args=(X, choices))\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndef calculate_probabilities(beta, X):\n    utility = X.dot(beta)\n    exp_util = np.exp(utility)\n    sum_exp_util = np.sum(exp_util.reshape(-1, n_products), axis=1)\n    probabilities = exp_util / np.repeat(sum_exp_util, n_products)\n    return probabilities.reshape(-1, n_products)\n\nestimated_beta = result.x\n# Calculate the initial choice probabilities for all products and all consumers\ninitial_probabilities = calculate_probabilities(estimated_beta, X)\n\n# Calculate the current market shares by taking the mean of probabilities across all consumers for each product\ncurrent_market_shares = np.mean(initial_probabilities, axis=0)\n\n# Display the new market shares\ncurrent_market_shares_df = pd.DataFrame({\n    'Product': ['Yogurt 1', 'Yogurt 2', 'Yogurt 3', 'Yogurt 4'],\n    'Current Market Share': current_market_shares\n})\n\ncurrent_market_shares_df\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduct\nCurrent Market Share\n\n\n\n\n0\nYogurt 1\n0.341975\n\n\n1\nYogurt 2\n0.401235\n\n\n2\nYogurt 3\n0.029218\n\n\n3\nYogurt 4\n0.227572\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe current market shares for the four yogurt products are approximately:\nYogurt 1: 34.2%\nYogurt 2: 40.1%\nYogurt 3: 2.9%\nYogurt 4: 22.8%\nNext, let‚Äôs increase the price of Yogurt 1 by $0.10 and then use the fitted model to predict the new choice probabilities.

This feature is preferred over the baseline of 2ft cargo space, as indicated by the positive coefficient. Consumers prefer more cargo space, all else being equal.\nEngine Hybrid and Electric: Both hybrid and electric engines are less preferred compared to a traditional gas engine, with electric being the least preferred among the options.\nUse the price coefficient as a dollar-per-util conversion factor. We could find the dollar value of 3ft of cargo space as compared to 2ft of cargo space:\n\n\nCode\n # Coefficients from the model results\ncargo_coeff = 0.4385\nprice_coeff = -0.1591\n\n# Calculate the dollar value of having 3ft of cargo space compared to 2ft\ndollar_value_cargo = (cargo_coeff / price_coeff) * (-1)\nprint(\"The Dolla Value of having 3ft cargo space compared to 2ft:\", round(dollar_value_cargo, 3))\n\n\nThe Dolla Value of having 3ft cargo space compared to 2ft: 2.756\n\n\nThe dollar value of having 3 feet of cargo space compared to 2 feet, based on the model, is approximately $2,756. This amount represents the additional value that respondents place on having an extra foot of cargo space in their vehicle choice.\nAssume the market consists of the following 6 minivans.

This minivan has the highest market share, suggesting that consumers highly value the combination of a lower price ($30) with standard features (6 seats, 2ft cargo, gas engine). This option appears to be the most cost-effective and appeals to the majority of consumers.\nMinivan C (31.31%): 8 seats, 2ft cargo, gas engine, $30. This minivan also has a significant market share, indicating that some consumers are willing to opt for a vehicle with more seating capacity at the same price. The additional seats (8 seats) add utility, making it an attractive option despite not being the top choice.\nModerate Market Share Minivan A (11.61%): 7 seats, 2ft cargo, hybrid engine, $30. The hybrid engine in this minivan reduces its market share compared to the purely gas-powered options at the same price point. While hybrid engines are generally valued for their efficiency, the preference in this case seems to be towards conventional gas engines at a lower price.\nLow Market Share Minivan F (5.24%): 7 seats, 2ft cargo, hybrid engine, $35. The increase in price to $35, coupled with similar features as Minivan A, significantly lowers its market share. This suggests that consumers are sensitive to price increases and are less inclined to pay an extra $5 for a similar hybrid vehicle with the same number of seats and cargo space.\nMinivan D (7.84%): 7 seats, 3ft cargo, gas engine, $40. Despite offering more cargo space (3ft), the higher price of $40 detracts from its attractiveness. This indicates that the additional cargo space does not compensate for the higher price for most consumers.\nMinivan E (2.04%): 6 seats, 2ft cargo, electric engine, $40. This minivan has the lowest market share, suggesting that consumers place a relatively low value on electric engines in this context, especially when paired with a high price. The cost does not justify the perceived benefits of the electric engine, resulting in minimal consumer interest.\nKey Takeaways:\nPrice Sensitivity: Consumers show a strong preference for lower-priced options. Minivans priced at $30 dominate the market shares, indicating high price sensitivity.\nEngine Type Preferences: Gas engines are favored over hybrid and electric engines, reflecting either cost concerns or possibly a lack of perceived additional value from alternative engine types at higher prices.\nFeature Trade-offs: Additional features like more seats or cargo space are valued but have a diminishing return when paired with higher prices. Consumers appear to balance their preferences for additional features with their willingness to pay more."

We start by estimating a simple Poisson model via Maximum Likelihood.\nThe Likelihood Function is: \\[\nL(\\lambda) = \\prod_{i=1}^n \\frac{e^{\\lambda}\\lambda^{Y_i}}{Y_i!}\n\\]\nThis can also be expressed as: \\[\nL(\\lambda) = e^{-n\\lambda} \\lambda^{\\sum_{i=1}^n Y_i} \\prod_{i=1}^n \\frac{1}{Y_i!}.\n\\]\nThe log-likelihood function is: \\[\n\\log L(\\lambda) = -n\\lambda + \\log(\\lambda) \\sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_i - \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\log(Y_i!)\n\\]\nDefine likelihood and log-likekihood function for the Poisson model\n\n\nCode\ndef poisson_likelihood(lam, Y):\n    n = len(Y)\n    sum_Y = np.sum(Y)\n    likelihood = np.exp(-n * lam) * (lam ** sum_Y) / np.prod([np.math.factorial(y) for y in Y])\n    return likelihood\n\ndef poisson_log_likelihood(lam, Y):\n    n = len(Y)\n    sum_Y = np.sum(Y)\n    log_likelihood = -n * lam + np.log(lam) * sum_Y - np.sum([np.log(np.math.factorial(y)) for y in Y])\n    return log_likelihood\n\n\nUse function to plot lambda\n\n\nCode\nimport warnings \nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\") \n\nY = data['patents']\n\n# Define the range for lambda values\nlambda_range = np.linspace(0.01, 10, 1000)  # Start from 0.01 to avoid log(0)\n\n# Calculate the log-likelihood for each lambda in the range\nlog_likelihood_values = [poisson_log_likelihood(lam, Y) for lam in lambda_range]\n\n# Plot the results\nplt.figure(figsize=(8, 3))\nplt.plot(lambda_range, log_likelihood_values, label='Log-Likelihood')\nplt.xlabel('Lambda (Œª)')\nplt.ylabel('Log-Likelihood')\nplt.title('Log-Likelihood of Observed Patent Counts Across Lambda Values')\nplt.legend()\nplt.grid(True)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo find the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for \\(\\lambda\\) , denoted as \\(\\lambda_{MLE}\\), we take the derivative of the log-likelihood with respect to \\(\\lambda\\) and set it equal to zero. The derivative is:\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{d\\lambda} \\log L(\\lambda) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left( -1 + \\frac{Y_i}{\\lambda} \\right)\n\\]\nSetting this derivative equal to zero for maximization gives:\n\\[\n0 = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left( -1 + \\frac{Y_i}{\\lambda} \\right)\n\\]\nSimplifying and solving for ( ) yields:\n\\[\n\\lambda_{MLE} = \\bar{Y} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_i\n\\]\nSo the MLE of \\(\\lambda\\) is the sample mean \\(\\bar{Y}\\), which is intuitive since for a Poisson distribution, the mean and variance are both equal to \\(\\lambda\\).\n\n\nCode\nlambda_mle = Y.mean()\nprint('Maximum Likelihood Estimator is',{lambda_mle})\n\n\nMaximum Likelihood Estimator is {3.6846666666666668}\n\n\nFind the MLE by optimizing your likelihood function with scipy.optimize in Python.\n\n\nCode\nfrom scipy.optimize import minimize\n\n# We define the negative log-likelihood function for the Poisson distribution\ndef negative_poisson_log_likelihood(lam, Y):\n    if lam &lt;= 0:  # Avoid log(0) for lam=0\n        return np.inf\n    n = len(Y)\n    sum_Y = np.sum(Y)\n    # The negative sign is important because we want to maximize the log-likelihood,\n    # which is equivalent to minimizing its negative.\n    neg_log_likelihood = n * lam - np.log(lam) * sum_Y + np.sum([np.log(np.math.factorial(y)) for y in Y])\n    return neg_log_likelihood\n\n# Initial guess for lambda can be the sample mean\ninitial_guess = [Y.mean()]\n\n# Minimize the negative log-likelihood function\nresult = minimize(\n    fun=negative_poisson_log_likelihood,\n    x0=initial_guess,\n    args=(Y,),\n    method='L-BFGS-B', # This optimization method allows for bounding the solution\n    bounds=[(1e-5, None)] # Lambda must be greater than 0\n)\n\n# Extract the MLE for lambda from the result\nlambda_mle = result.x[0] if result.success else None\nprint('Maximum Likelihood Estimator is',{lambda_mle})\n\n\nMaximum Likelihood Estimator is {3.6846666666666668}\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we extend our simple Poisson model to a Poisson Regression Model such that \\(Y_i = \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda_i)\\) where \\(\\lambda_i = \\exp(X_i'\\beta)\\). The interpretation is that the success rate of patent awards is not constant across all firms (\\(\\lambda\\)) but rather is a function of firm characteristics \\(X_i\\).

This suggests a positive relationship between the age of the patent application (or applicant) and the likelihood of success.With p &lt; 0.001, this variable indicates a strong positive relationship with the outcome as age increases, up to a point (due to the quadratic term).\nage squared:The negative coefficient for age squared indicates a diminishing return effect; as age increases, its positive impact on patent success starts to decrease. This typically suggests a peak point beyond which additional years in age reduce the likelihood of success. Also with p &lt; 0.001, it confirms the non-linear relationship where increasing age has diminishing returns on the log odds of the outcome.\niscustomer: Being a customer is associated with an increase in the log-odds of patent success by 0.1181 compared to non-customers. This effect is statistically significant and suggests that customers of Blueprinty might have a higher likelihood of patent success. This variable is statistically significant (p = 0.002), showing that being a customer positively influences the outcome.\nRegional Effects:\n\n\nNortheast: Indicates a positive effect on patent success in the Northeast compared to the baseline region (the one dropped during dummy coding).\nNorthwest: Suggests a slight negative effect on patent success compared to the baseline, but this may not be statistically significant.\nSouth and Southwest: Both regions show a positive effect on patent success, though the effects are small and the confidence around these estimates might overlap with zero, suggesting limited statistical significance.\n\nConclusions:\n\nAge: There‚Äôs a clear positive relationship between age and patent success, which peaks and then starts to decline as indicated by the quadratic term (age squared). This could reflect that mid-career individuals or entities are most successful in patent applications, possibly due to optimal combinations of experience and active engagement in their fields.\nCustomer Status: Being a customer of Blueprinty has a positive impact on patent success. This suggests that the services or products provided by Blueprinty are effective in enhancing the success rate of patents for their customers.\nRegional Variations: There are some regional differences in patent success rates, with the Northeast and Southern regions showing a positive impact relative to the baseline region."

We start by estimating a simple Poisson model via Maximum Likelihood.\nThe Likelihood Function is: \\[\nL(\\lambda) = \\prod_{i=1}^n \\frac{e^{\\lambda}\\lambda^{Y_i}}{Y_i!}\n\\]\nThis can also be expressed as: \\[\nL(\\lambda) = e^{-n\\lambda} \\lambda^{\\sum_{i=1}^n Y_i} \\prod_{i=1}^n \\frac{1}{Y_i!}.\n\\]\nThe log-likelihood function is: \\[\n\\log L(\\lambda) = -n\\lambda + \\log(\\lambda) \\sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_i - \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\log(Y_i!)\n\\]\nDefine likelihood and log-likekihood function for the Poisson model\n\n\nCode\ndef poisson_likelihood(lam, Y):\n    n = len(Y)\n    sum_Y = np.sum(Y)\n    likelihood = np.exp(-n * lam) * (lam ** sum_Y) / np.prod([np.math.factorial(y) for y in Y])\n    return likelihood\n\ndef poisson_log_likelihood(lam, Y):\n    n = len(Y)\n    sum_Y = np.sum(Y)\n    log_likelihood = -n * lam + np.log(lam) * sum_Y - np.sum([np.log(np.math.factorial(y)) for y in Y])\n    return log_likelihood\n\n\nUse function to plot lambda\n\n\nCode\nimport warnings \nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\") \n\nY = data['patents']\n\n# Define the range for lambda values\nlambda_range = np.linspace(0.01, 10, 1000)  # Start from 0.01 to avoid log(0)\n\n# Calculate the log-likelihood for each lambda in the range\nlog_likelihood_values = [poisson_log_likelihood(lam, Y) for lam in lambda_range]\n\n# Plot the results\nplt.figure(figsize=(8, 3))\nplt.plot(lambda_range, log_likelihood_values, label='Log-Likelihood')\nplt.xlabel('Lambda (Œª)')\nplt.ylabel('Log-Likelihood')\nplt.title('Log-Likelihood of Observed Patent Counts Across Lambda Values')\nplt.legend()\nplt.grid(True)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo find the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for \\(\\lambda\\) , denoted as \\(\\lambda_{MLE}\\), we take the derivative of the log-likelihood with respect to \\(\\lambda\\) and set it equal to zero. The derivative is:\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{d\\lambda} \\log L(\\lambda) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left( -1 + \\frac{Y_i}{\\lambda} \\right)\n\\]\nSetting this derivative equal to zero for maximization gives:\n\\[\n0 = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\left( -1 + \\frac{Y_i}{\\lambda} \\right)\n\\]\nSimplifying and solving for ( ) yields:\n\\[\n\\lambda_{MLE} = \\bar{Y} = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_i\n\\]\nSo the MLE of \\(\\lambda\\) is the sample mean \\(\\bar{Y}\\), which is intuitive since for a Poisson distribution, the mean and variance are both equal to \\(\\lambda\\).\n\n\nCode\nlambda_mle = Y.mean()\nprint('Maximum Likelihood Estimator is',{lambda_mle})\n\n\nMaximum Likelihood Estimator is {3.6846666666666668}\n\n\nFind the MLE by optimizing your likelihood function with scipy.optimize in Python.\n\n\nCode\nfrom scipy.optimize import minimize\n\n# We define the negative log-likelihood function for the Poisson distribution\ndef negative_poisson_log_likelihood(lam, Y):\n    if lam &lt;= 0:  # Avoid log(0) for lam=0\n        return np.inf\n    n = len(Y)\n    sum_Y = np.sum(Y)\n    # The negative sign is important because we want to maximize the log-likelihood,\n    # which is equivalent to minimizing its negative.\n    neg_log_likelihood = n * lam - np.log(lam) * sum_Y + np.sum([np.log(np.math.factorial(y)) for y in Y])\n    return neg_log_likelihood\n\n# Initial guess for lambda can be the sample mean\ninitial_guess = [Y.mean()]\n\n# Minimize the negative log-likelihood function\nresult = minimize(\n    fun=negative_poisson_log_likelihood,\n    x0=initial_guess,\n    args=(Y,),\n    method='L-BFGS-B', # This optimization method allows for bounding the solution\n    bounds=[(1e-5, None)] # Lambda must be greater than 0\n)\n\n# Extract the MLE for lambda from the result\nlambda_mle = result.x[0] if result.success else None\nprint('Maximum Likelihood Estimator is',{lambda_mle})\n\n\nMaximum Likelihood Estimator is {3.6846666666666668}\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we extend our simple Poisson model to a Poisson Regression Model such that \\(Y_i = \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda_i)\\) where \\(\\lambda_i = \\exp(X_i'\\beta)\\).

This suggests a positive relationship between the age of the patent application (or applicant) and the likelihood of success.With p &lt; 0.001, this variable indicates a strong positive relationship with the outcome as age increases, up to a point (due to the quadratic term).\nage squared:The negative coefficient for age squared indicates a diminishing return effect; as age increases, its positive impact on patent success starts to decrease. This typically suggests a peak point beyond which additional years in age reduce the likelihood of success. Also with p &lt; 0.001, it confirms the non-linear relationship where increasing age has diminishing returns on the log odds of the outcome.\niscustomer: Being a customer is associated with an increase in the log-odds of patent success by 0.1181 compared to non-customers. This effect is statistically significant and suggests that customers of Blueprinty might have a higher likelihood of patent success. This variable is statistically significant (p = 0.002), showing that being a customer positively influences the outcome.\nRegional Effects:\n\n\nNortheast: Indicates a positive effect on patent success in the Northeast compared to the baseline region (the one dropped during dummy coding).\nNorthwest: Suggests a slight negative effect on patent success compared to the baseline, but this may not be statistically significant.\nSouth and Southwest: Both regions show a positive effect on patent success, though the effects are small and the confidence around these estimates might overlap with zero, suggesting limited statistical significance.\n\nConclusions:\n\nAge: There‚Äôs a clear positive relationship between age and patent success, which peaks and then starts to decline as indicated by the quadratic term (age squared). This could reflect that mid-career individuals or entities are most successful in patent applications, possibly due to optimal combinations of experience and active engagement in their fields.\nCustomer Status: Being a customer of Blueprinty has a positive impact on patent success. This suggests that the services or products provided by Blueprinty are effective in enhancing the success rate of patents for their customers.\nRegional Variations: There are some regional differences in patent success rates, with the Northeast and Southern regions showing a positive impact relative to the baseline region."

An alternative approach is to create a binary indicator variable for each of these scores, which will indicate whether the score was originally missing. This way, we retain all listings in our analysis and potentially capture some information about why scores might be missing (e.g., newer listings might not have scores yet).\nImpute missing review scores with the median\n\n\nCode\n# Create binary indicators for missing review scores\nairbnb['cleanliness_missing'] = airbnb['review_scores_cleanliness'].isnull().astype(int)\nairbnb['location_missing'] = airbnb['review_scores_location'].isnull().astype(int)\nairbnb['value_missing'] = airbnb['review_scores_value'].isnull().astype(int)\n\n# Impute missing review scores with the median\nairbnb['review_scores_cleanliness'].fillna(airbnb['review_scores_cleanliness'].median(), inplace=True)\nairbnb['review_scores_location'].fillna(airbnb['review_scores_location'].median(), inplace=True)\nairbnb['review_scores_value'].fillna(airbnb['review_scores_value'].median(), inplace=True)\n\n# Check if all missing values are addressed\nfinal_missing_values_check = airbnb.isnull().sum()\nfinal_missing_values_check\n\n\nid                            0\ndays                          0\nlast_scraped                  0\nhost_since                   35\nroom_type                     0\nbathrooms                     0\nbedrooms                      0\nprice                         0\nnumber_of_reviews             0\nreview_scores_cleanliness     0\nreview_scores_location        0\nreview_scores_value           0\ninstant_bookable              0\ncleanliness_missing           0\nlocation_missing              0\nvalue_missing                 0\ndtype: int64\n\n\nAll the missing values in the review scores have been addressed, and we now have binary indicators for whether the original scores were missing.

This might reflect a preference or higher turnover in these types of listings.\nPrice:\nThe relationship between price and number of reviews is not linear, suggesting that very high or very low priced listings might have fewer reviews. The logarithmic scale on price helps in visualizing this across a wide range of values.\nReview Scores:\nThere isn‚Äôt a clear trend in the scatter plots between review scores and the number of reviews, indicating that while scores may affect guest satisfaction, they do not necessarily correlate directly with the frequency of bookings (as measured by reviews). There might be a slight increase in reviews with higher scores for cleanliness and value.\n\n\nBuild Poisson Regression Model\n\n\nCode\nfrom patsy import dmatrices\n# Convert variables to the same time interval\n\nairbnb['last_scraped'] = pd.to_datetime(airbnb['last_scraped'])\nairbnb['host_since'] = pd.to_datetime(airbnb['host_since'])\n\n# Calculate the duration in years that each listing has been active\nairbnb['duration_years'] = (airbnb['last_scraped'] - airbnb['host_since']).dt.days / 365.25\n\n# Compute reviews per year\nairbnb['reviews_per_year'] = airbnb['number_of_reviews'] / airbnb['duration_years']\n\n# Handle cases where duration_years is zero to avoid division by zero\nairbnb['reviews_per_year'].fillna(0, inplace=True)\n\n\n# Encoding categorical variables using patsy (for statsmodels compatibility)\nformula = \"\"\"reviews_per_year ~ room_type + bathrooms + bedrooms + price +\n             review_scores_cleanliness + review_scores_location +\n             review_scores_value + cleanliness_missing + location_missing + value_missing\"\"\"\n\n# Prepare the design matrices for regression\ny, X = dmatrices(formula, airbnb, return_type='dataframe')\n\n# Fit a Poisson regression model using the same training data\npoisson_model = sm.GLM(y, X, family=sm.families.Poisson())\npoisson_results = poisson_model.fit()\n\npoisson_summary = poisson_results.summary()\n\n# Extract only the regression results table\npoisson_results_table = poisson_summary.tables[1]\n\n# To display or print out the table\nprint(poisson_results_table)\n\n\n=============================================================================================\n                                coef    std err          z      P&gt;|z|      [0.025      0.975]\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIntercept                     2.1560      0.026     84.372      0.000       2.106       2.206\nroom_type[T.Private room]     0.0338      0.004      7.737      0.000       0.025       0.042\nroom_type[T.Shared room]      0.0871      0.012      7.525      0.000       0.064       0.110\nbathrooms                     0.0105      0.006      1.903      0.057      -0.000       0.021\nbedrooms                      0.0811      0.003     25.960      0.000       0.075       0.087\nprice                        -0.0002   1.86e-05    -12.370      0.000      -0.000      -0.000\nreview_scores_cleanliness     0.1249      0.002     53.488      0.000       0.120       0.129\nreview_scores_location       -0.0711      0.003    -28.236      0.000      -0.076      -0.066\nreview_scores_value          -0.0577      0.003    -20.285      0.000      -0.063      -0.052\ncleanliness_missing          -2.2750      0.122    -18.625      0.000      -2.514      -2.036\nlocation_missing             -1.1305      0.148     -7.651      0.000      -1.420      -0.841\nvalue_missing                -1.4111      0.145     -9.734      0.000      -1.695      -1.127\n=============================================================================================\n\n\n\n\nBuild Binomial Regression Model\n\n\nCode\n# #

The effect is relatively small\nShare room: Shared rooms are expected to have more reviews than the baseline category. Shared rooms show a stronger positive association with the number of reviews compared to private rooms.\n\n\nbathrooms: More bathrooms are associated with more reviews, indicating that listings with more bathrooms might be more frequently booked or reviewed.\nbedrooms: More bedrooms are associated with an increase in the expected count of reviews, suggesting that larger properties might attract more bookings and thus more reviews\nprice: A higher price is slightly negatively associated with the number of reviews. This small coeficient suggests that price inceases might slightly reduce the likelihood of getting reviewed.\nReview scores:\n\n\ncleanliness: higher clealiness scrores are positively associated with more reviews, indicating that cleanser listings are more likely to receive reviews.\nlocation: Surprisingly, better location scores are associated with fewer reviews. This might reflex a complex interaction with other factors not captured in the model or the properties in desiable locations might not meet all guest expectations or that guests in such locations review less frequently.\nvalue: Better value scores are also negatively associated with the number of reviews, which might suggest that guest have higher expectations that aren‚Äôt met as often they rate the value highly.\n\n\nMissing Indicators:\n\n\ncleanliness missing: Listing missing cleanliness scores have significantly fewer reviews, possibly indicating newer or less popular listings.\nlocation missing: Similarly, listings missing location scores have fewer reviews\nvalue missing: Listing missing value scores also have fewer reviews."

The intuit75k.parquet file contains data on 75,000 (small) businesses that were selected randomly from the 801,821 that were sent the wave-1 mailing. The mailing contained an offer to upgrade to the latest version of the Quickbooks software.\nVariable res1 denotes which of these businesses responded to the mailing by purchasing Quickbooks version 3.0 from Intuit Direct. Note that Intuit Direct sells products directly to its customers rather than through a retailer. Use the available data to predict which businesses that did not respond to the wave-1 mailing, are most likely to respond to the wave-2 mailing. Note that variables were added, deleted, and recoded so please ignore the variable descriptions in Exhibit 3 in the case in the course reader. Instead, use the variable descriptions below:\n\nVariable description\n\nid: Small business customer ID\nzip5: 5-Digit ZIP Code (00000=unknown, 99999=international ZIPs).\nzip_bins: Zip-code bins (20 approx. equal sized bins from lowest to highest zip code number)\nsex: Gender Identity ‚ÄúFemale‚Äù, ‚ÄúMale‚Äù, or ‚ÄúUnknown‚Äù\nbizflag: Business Flag.

We will also be reviewing our dataset to ensure tha there are no null values, and that the data types are aligned.\n\nintuit75k.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid\nzip5\nzip_bins\nsex\nbizflag\nnumords\ndollars\nlast\nsincepurch\nversion1\nowntaxprod\nupgraded\nres1\ntraining\nres1_yes\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\n94553\n18\nMale\n0\n2\n109.5\n5\n12\n0\n0\n0\nNo\n1\n0\n\n\n1\n2\n53190\n10\nUnknown\n0\n1\n69.5\n4\n3\n0\n0\n0\nNo\n0\n0\n\n\n2\n3\n37091\n8\nMale\n0\n4\n93.0\n14\n29\n0\n0\n1\nNo\n0\n0\n\n\n3\n4\n02125\n1\nMale\n0\n1\n22.0\n17\n1\n0\n0\n0\nNo\n1\n0\n\n\n4\n5\n60201\n11\nMale\n0\n1\n24.5\n2\n3\n0\n0\n0\nNo\n0\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nintuit75k.hist(figsize=(20, 20))\n\narray([[&lt;Axes: title={'center': 'id'}&gt;,\n        &lt;Axes: title={'center': 'zip_bins'}&gt;,\n        &lt;Axes: title={'center': 'bizflag'}&gt;],\n       [&lt;Axes: title={'center': 'numords'}&gt;,\n        &lt;Axes: title={'center': 'dollars'}&gt;,\n        &lt;Axes: title={'center': 'last'}&gt;],\n       [&lt;Axes: title={'center': 'sincepurch'}&gt;,\n        &lt;Axes: title={'center': 'version1'}&gt;,\n        &lt;Axes: title={'center': 'owntaxprod'}&gt;],\n       [&lt;Axes: title={'center': 'upgraded'}&gt;,\n        &lt;Axes: title={'center': 'training'}&gt;,\n        &lt;Axes: title={'center': 'res1_yes'}&gt;]], dtype=object)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrior to creating any models, we want to review the distribution and scale of the variables in the dataset. If there is scale in the distribution of the variables as exemplified by the histograms produced above, this will effect the ability of our model to accurately and effectively predict the response to our second wave mailing outreach. Based on the distribution of the histograms above, the variable with the greatest skew is the dollars. It skews heavily towards the left, as do the numrods and sincepurch variables. Due to this, we will want to apply some type of transformation to these variables to normalize their distribution.\n\ntrain_data = intuit75k[intuit75k['training'] == 1]\n\nHere we are creating our training set of data. This corresponds to any record that has a 1 in the training column within the Intuit75k database. As per the intuit instructions, the data was already pre-split into 70:30 training:test sets. If the data was not pre-split, we would want to consider employing the StratifyShuffleSplit method to create our training and testing data. This would ensure that our training and test sets have the same number of yes‚Äôs, which would provide a more accurate and representative dataset for the training and testing of our model.\n\nintuit75k['res1'].value_counts()\n\nres1\nNo     71399\nYes     3601\nName: count, dtype: int64\n\n\n\n\nCorrelation Between Features\nIn addition to scaling the data before we start building our models, we want to identify any potential correlation between the features in our dataset. If any features are highly correlated, this could lead to multi-collinearity within our models and lead to inflation of the variable coefficients or inflated importance of features on our model. If we are able to identify any correlation prior to building our model, we are able to adjust which features are correlated and see how this might increase their importance if a highly-correlated feature is omitted from the model.\n\ncorr_columns = ['zip_bins','bizflag','numords','dollars','last','sincepurch']\ncorr_matrix = train_data[corr_columns].corr()\ncorr_matrix\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nzip_bins\nbizflag\nnumords\ndollars\nlast\nsincepurch\n\n\n\n\nzip_bins\n1.000000\n-0.000679\n0.005397\n0.006667\n-0.000726\n-0.001555\n\n\nbizflag\n-0.000679\n1.000000\n-0.000113\n0.002398\n0.000647\n-0.003839\n\n\nnumords\n0.005397\n-0.000113\n1.000000\n0.587267\n-0.130395\n0.000284\n\n\ndollars\n0.006667\n0.002398\n0.587267\n1.000000\n-0.073897\n0.003649\n\n\nlast\n-0.000726\n0.000647\n-0.130395\n-0.073897\n1.000000\n-0.001506\n\n\nsincepurch\n-0.001555\n-0.003839\n0.000284\n0.003649\n-0.001506\n1.000000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the correlation matrix created above, we see that there is not a high level of correlation between the features of this dataset. A high level of correlation is traditionally considered within the range of 0.7 and 0.9. Correlation coefficients whose magnitude is between 0.5 and 0.7 indicates that variables are moderately correlated. Dollars and numrods have a moderate correlation value of 0.59. It would make sense that these variables have a moderate correlation. The numrod variable represents number of orders from Intuit Direct in the previous 36 months, whereas Dollars represents the total dollar value ordered from intuit direct in the previous 36 months. Traditionally, orders and dollar value tend to have a positive - direct relationship, as we see orders increase, we expect to see dollars increase as well."

First, we want to take a look at our Pseudo R-squared (McFadden) and Pseudo R-squared (McFadden Adjusted) values. Based on our output, we see that these values are 0.073 and 0.07, respectively. The Pseudo R-squared values are generally lower than the traditional R-squared in linear regression models and don‚Äôt have a fixed range. However, the values for our McFadden and McFadden are still on the lower side. This isn‚Äôt automatically a deal-breaker for this model or automatically a reason to throw our model away, but we would want weigh these R-squared values in conjunction with other factors (such as AUC, and Chi-squared) to evaluate the effectiveness and predictive performance of our model. \nIn addition to the r-squared values, we also want to evaluate the AUC value. AUC indicates a model‚Äôs ability to discriminate between a positive and negative class. The AUC value is on a fixed scale, with a base threshold of 0.5. Any value over 0.5 is considered to be a better value, and indicate a better model. Our first logisitic regression model had an AUC of 0.708 which suggests that the model has a good ability to distinguish between the two classes (i.e.¬†responded to the mailing offer or not). We can also use the AIC and BIC values to evaluate our model as well. The AIC and BIC respectively represent the Akaike Information Criterion and the Bayesian Information Criterion. These values also indicate the models‚Äôs fit to the data. Generally, the goal is to have a lower AIC and BIC value, and models with lower AIC and BIC values are preferred. Our model has an AIC value of 18688.123, and the BIC value of 18794.545. These values are a bit difficult to represent or evaluate at first, but will become more important when we begin to omit variables and see how these values change. If both the AIC and BIC values become lower when removing a variable, we would consider using the model that produces the lower values.\nFinally, the most important value when evaluating a models performance is the Chi-squared value. The Chi-squared value of 1425.521 with 11 degrees of freedom and a p.value &lt; 0.001 suggests that the model as a whole is statistically significant, and at least some of the predictors or features in this model are significantly related to the outcome. Therefore, our first logistic regression model with all of the variables included seems to be a statistically significant model with a decent prediction ability. We would want to consider removing any statistically insignificant variables to see how the model‚Äôs performance changes, in hopes of building a more powerful prediction model.\n\nlr.plot(\"vimp\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPermutation Importance Plot Interpretation\nBased on the permutation importance graph above, we can see that the variables of importance are upgraded, last, zip_bins, numrods, version1, owntaxprod, dollars. These variables however, do not contribute to a very large decrease in AUC, but this graph allows us to view the ratio of importance of the variables. Additionally, we can see that the bizflag, sincepurch, and sex variables are not important. Based on their lack of importance via AUC decrease, and their statistical insignificance, as identified by their high p-values in the logistic regression summary, we will consider testing their removal from the model and seeing if the model‚Äôs performance changes.\n\nlr.plot(\"pred\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrediction Plot Interpretation\nBased on the prediction plots above, it looks like gender has very little influence of a prediction value. Similarily bizflag, and since_purch also looks insignificant, and doesn‚Äôt seem to contribute much to the prediction value. Therefore, we will want to remove them from this logistic regression model to see if the new logistic regression improves the AUC and r^2 value.\n\n\nTesting the removal of features from the model\nAs mentioned above, bizflag, sincepurch, and sex all have low importance and are statistically insignificant to our model, as indicated by their high p-values. We want to test removing them from our model to see if the performance of our model changes. The change in model performance will be interpreted based on how the AUC, BIC, Pseudo R-Squared, and Chi-squared values change in comparison to our baseline model with all of the features included as explanatory variables.\n\n\nRemoving bizflag, sincepurch, and sex together\n\nlr.summary(main = False, test=['sincepurch', 'sex','bizflag'])\n\n\nPseudo R-squared (McFadden): 0.071\nPseudo R-squared (McFadden adjusted): 0.07\nArea under the RO Curve (AUC): 0.709\nLog-likelihood: -9332.061, AIC: 18688.123, BIC: 18794.545\nChi-squared: 1425.521, df(11), p.value &lt; 0.001 \nNr obs: 52,500\n\nModel 1: res1_yes ~ zip_bins + numords + dollars + last + version1 + owntaxprod + upgraded\nModel 2: res1_yes ~ zip_bins + bizflag + numords + dollars + last + sincepurch + sex + version1 + owntaxprod + upgraded\nPseudo R-squared, Model 1 vs 2: 0.071 vs 0.071\nChi-squared: 1.257 df (4), p.value 0.869\n\n\n\nModel Interpretation\nWe first wanted to see the model‚Äôs performance when we removed sincepurch, sex, and bizflag together from the model. As identified above, we noticed that these variables had the lowest importance to the model and were statistically insignificant to the baseline logistic regression model. The test function enables us to generate a logistic regression output as if we were generating the models without these variables being included. We are then able to compare the model‚Äôs performance with and without them included. As we see, the first output shows our baseline model‚Äôs output. We see the same metrics that were identified previously.\n The second output shows us the Pseudo R-squared values in the baseline logit model vs.¬†our new model with the variables being removed. As we see via the output, the Pseudo r-squared value does not change in model 1 vs.¬†model 2, this indicates that the overall explanatory power of the models is unchanged despite the removal of the sincepurch,sex, and bizflag variables. However, the chi-squared value and the p.value change significantly, which is critical. The chi-squared value of 1.257 with 4 degrees of freedom and a p-value of 0.869 from comparing Model 1 and Model 2 suggests that the variables removed do not significantly contribute to the model. A high p-value (p &gt; 0.05) indicates that there is no significant loss (or gain) in explanatory power due to these changes.\n essentially, the comparison suggests that the removal of bizflag, sincepurch, and sex between Model 1 and Model 2 does not significantly affect the model‚Äôs explanatory power or predictive ability. This is indicated by the unchanged Pseudo R-squared values and the non-significant chi-squared test for the comparison. Therefore, if removing variables does not significantly decrease the model‚Äôs performance, it might be beneficial to keep the model simpler by excluding them. A simpler model is easier to interpret and may generalize better to new data. We will also want to test the removal of the variables one by one to see if that improves the model‚Äôs explanatory power.\n\n\n\nRemoving sincepurch, and sex\n\nlr.summary(main = False, test = ['sincepurch', 'sex'])\n\n\nPseudo R-squared (McFadden): 0.071\nPseudo R-squared (McFadden adjusted): 0.07\nArea under the RO Curve (AUC): 0.709\nLog-likelihood: -9332.061, AIC: 18688.123, BIC: 18794.545\nChi-squared: 1425.521, df(11), p.value &lt; 0.001 \nNr obs: 52,500\n\nModel 1: res1_yes ~ zip_bins + bizflag + numords + dollars + last + version1 + owntaxprod + upgraded\nModel 2: res1_yes ~ zip_bins + bizflag + numords + dollars + last + sincepurch + sex + version1 + owntaxprod + upgraded\nPseudo R-squared, Model 1 vs 2: 0.071 vs 0.071\nChi-squared: 0.331 df (3), p.value 0.954\n\n\n\nModel interpretation\nIn the previous section, we evaluated the performance of our logistic regression model when we removed the three insignificant variables from our model as interpreted from their individual p-values. In this removal round, we wanted to evalute the performance of our logistic regression model if we considered removing sincepurch and sex. Both models have the same Pseudo R-squared values (0.071), which suggests that the overall explanatory power of the models is unchanged despite the removal or addition of variables. Additionally, The chi-squared value of 0.331 with 3 degrees of freedom and a p-value of 0.954 from comparing Model 1 and Model 2 suggests that the variables removed (or added) do not significantly contribute to the model. A high p-value (p &gt; 0.05) indicates that there is no significant loss (or gain) in explanatory power due to these changes. This indicates that we might want to consider removing them completely from the model as they don‚Äôt increase the explanatory power of the model.\n\n\n\nRemoving sex\n\nlr.summary(main = False, test = ['sex'])\n\n\nPseudo R-squared (McFadden): 0.071\nPseudo R-squared (McFadden adjusted): 0.07\nArea under the RO Curve (AUC): 0.709\nLog-likelihood: -9332.061, AIC: 18688.123, BIC: 18794.545\nChi-squared: 1425.521, df(11), p.value &lt; 0.001 \nNr obs: 52,500\n\nModel 1: res1_yes ~ zip_bins + bizflag + numords + dollars + last + sincepurch + version1 + owntaxprod + upgraded\nModel 2: res1_yes ~ zip_bins + bizflag + numords + dollars + last + sincepurch + sex + version1 + owntaxprod + upgraded\nPseudo R-squared, Model 1 vs 2: 0.071 vs 0.071\nChi-squared: 0.062 df (2), p.value 0.97\n\n\n\nModel interpretation\nIn this removal round, we wanted to evaluate the performance of our logistic regression model if we tested the removal of sex. Both models have the same Pseudo R-squared values (0.071), which suggests that the overall explanatory power of the models is unchanged despite the removal or addition of variables. Additionally, The chi-squared value of 0.062 with 2 degrees of freedom and a p-value of 0.97 from comparing Model 1 and Model 2 suggests that the variables removed (or added) do not significantly contribute to the model. A high p-value (p &gt; 0.05) indicates that there is no significant loss (or gain) in explanatory power due to these changes. This indicates that we might want to consider removing them completely from the model as they don‚Äôt increase the explanatory power of the model.\n\n\n\nRemoving sincepurch\n\nlr.summary(main = False, test=['sincepurch'])\n\n\nPseudo R-squared (McFadden): 0.071\nPseudo R-squared (McFadden adjusted): 0.07\nArea under the RO Curve (AUC): 0.709\nLog-likelihood: -9332.061, AIC: 18688.123, BIC: 18794.545\nChi-squared: 1425.521, df(11), p.value &lt; 0.001 \nNr obs: 52,500\n\nModel 1: res1_yes ~ zip_bins + bizflag + numords + dollars + last + sex + version1 + owntaxprod + upgraded\nModel 2: res1_yes ~ zip_bins + bizflag + numords + dollars + last + sincepurch + sex + version1 + owntaxprod + upgraded\nPseudo R-squared, Model 1 vs 2: 0.071 vs 0.071\nChi-squared: 0.268 df (1), p.value 0.605\n\n\n\nModel interpretation\nIn this removal round, we wanted to evaluate the performance of our logistic regression model if we tested the removal of sincepurch. Both models have the same Pseudo R-squared values (0.071), which suggests that the overall explanatory power of the models is unchanged despite the removal or addition of variables. Additionally, The chi-squared value of 0.268 with 1 degrees of freedom and a p-value of 0.605 from comparing Model 1 and Model 2 suggests that the variables removed (or added) do not significantly contribute to the model. A high p-value (p &gt; 0.05) indicates that there is no significant loss (or gain) in explanatory power due to these changes.

Additionally, The chi-squared value of 0.331 with 3 degrees of freedom and a p-value of 0.954 from comparing Model 1 and Model 2 suggests that the variables removed (or added) do not significantly contribute to the model. A high p-value (p &gt; 0.05) indicates that there is no significant loss (or gain) in explanatory power due to these changes. This indicates that we might want to consider removing them completely from the model as they don‚Äôt increase the explanatory power of the model.\n The comparison between Model 1 and Model 2 with Pseudo R-squared, Model 1 vs 2: 0.070 vs 0.071 and Chi-squared: 12.732 df (1), p.value &lt; .001 shows a minor improvement in the Pseudo R-squared from Model 1 to Model 2, indicating a slightly better fit in Model 2. The chi-squared value being significant (p &lt; .001) for the comparison suggests that the change between models (likely the inclusion of dollars in Model 2) significantly improves the model‚Äôs fit to the data.\n\n\n\nRemoving owntaxprod\n\nlr.summary(main = False, test=['owntaxprod'])\n\n\nPseudo R-squared (McFadden): 0.071\nPseudo R-squared (McFadden adjusted): 0.07\nArea under the RO Curve (AUC): 0.709\nLog-likelihood: -9332.061, AIC: 18688.123, BIC: 18794.545\nChi-squared: 1425.521, df(11), p.value &lt; 0.001 \nNr obs: 52,500\n\nModel 1: res1_yes ~ zip_bins + bizflag + numords + dollars + last + sincepurch + sex + version1 + upgraded\nModel 2: res1_yes ~ zip_bins + bizflag + numords + dollars + last + sincepurch + sex + version1 + owntaxprod + upgraded\nPseudo R-squared, Model 1 vs 2: 0.071 vs 0.071\nChi-squared: 8.694 df (1), p.value 0.003\n\n\n\nModel interpretation\nModel 1 and Model 2 are logistic regression models predicting the binary outcome res_yes_no using different sets of explanatory variables. The primary difference between the models is the inclusion of owntaxprod in Model 2, which is not present in Model 1. Pseudo R-squared for Model 1 vs.¬†Model 2: 0.071 vs.¬†0.071. This metric provides a measure of the explanatory power of the models, with values closer to 1 indicating a better fit. The identical Pseudo R-squared values for both models suggest that they have the same explanatory power, meaning the addition of owntaxprod in Model 2 does not improve the model‚Äôs ability to explain the variability in the outcome res_yes_no.\nChi-squared: 8.694, df (1), p.value 0.003. This test compares the two models to determine if the addition of the owntaxprod variable in Model 2 significantly improves the model fit compared to Model 1. The chi-squared statistic is used to assess this, with the degrees of freedom (df) typically representing the difference in the number of parameters estimated between the two models. In this case, the df is 1, corresponding to the one additional variable in Model 2. The p-value of 0.003 indicates that the difference in fit between Model 1 and Model 2 is statistically significant at conventional significance levels (e.g., Œ± = 0.05). Therefore, despite the Pseudo R-squared values being identical, the statistical test suggests that owntaxprod provides a significant contribution to predicting the outcome when it is added to the model. \nGiven these results, we would probably want to include owntaxprod in our model. However, some other factors we would want to consider are:\n\n\nModel complexity: Adding more variables can make the model more complex and potentially harder to interpret.\n\n\nPractical significance: Evaluate whether the inclusion of owntaxprod has practical significance in addition to its statistical significance.\n\n\nCross-validation: Perform cross-validation to assess the generalizability of the model and avoid overfitting.\n\n\nFurther evaluation: Consider other metrics such as AUC, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score for a more comprehensive evaluation of model performance, especially in the context of the specific application or decision-making process the model is intended to support.\n\n\n\nCheck cross-validation\n\nct = rsm.basics.cross_tabs({'intuit75k'

and the upgrade status (upgraded) are the most influential factors in predicting the yes/no response variable in your Multi-layer Perceptron model. The importance of zip_bins suggests that location-based characteristics are crucial in the model‚Äôs decision-making process. The prominence of last indicates that recent interactions or activities have a significant impact on the predictions, and the positive trend with upgraded implies that customers who have upgraded are more likely to yield a positive response.\n\nclf1.plot(\"pred\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe partial dependence plots show a nuanced view of feature influences. A steeper slope for the zip_bins plot underscores its importance, aligning with the permutation importance results. Other variables like numords, dollars, version1, owntaxprod, and upgraded appear to have a more muted effect on the model‚Äôs output. Overall, the model‚Äôs predictive behavior is mostly swayed by where the customer is located, with other factors playing secondary roles.\nWe wanted to first create a base line neural network model. However, as we can see by the prediction plots, this nn model does not provide much in terms of the predictability based on various variables. We will want to build a neural network with more nodes and more hidden layers, and make our model a bit more flexible.\n\ndct = {\"train\": intuit75k[intuit75k.training == 1], \"test\": intuit75k[intuit75k.training == 0]}\nfig = rsm.gains_plot(dct, \"res1\", \"Yes\", \"pred_nn1\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNN with hidden layers sizes: (2, )\n\nclf2 = rsm.model.mlp(\n    data= {'wave1':intuit75k.query('training == 1')},\n    rvar=\"res1_yes\",\n    evar=[\n        'zip_bins',\n        'bizflag',\n        'sex',\n        'sincepurch',\n        'numords',\n        'dollars',\n        'last',\n        'owntaxprod',\n        'version1',\n        'upgraded',\n        'zip801',\n        'zip804'\n    ],\n    hidden_layer_sizes=(2,),\n    mod_type=\"classification\",\n)\nclf2.summary()\n\nMulti-layer Perceptron (NN)\nData                 : wave1\nResponse variable    : res1_yes\nLevel                : None\nExplanatory variables: zip_bins, bizflag, sex, sincepurch, numords, dollars, last, owntaxprod, version1, upgraded, zip801, zip804\nModel type           : classification\nNr. of features      : (12, 31)\nNr. of observations  : 52,500\nHidden_layer_sizes   : (2,)\nActivation function  : tanh\nSolver               : lbfgs\nAlpha                : 0.0001\nBatch size           : auto\nLearning rate        : 0.001\nMaximum iterations   : 10000\nrandom_state         : 1234\nAUC                  : 0.777\n\nRaw data             :\nzip_bins  bizflag  sex  sincepurch  numords  dollars  last  owntaxprod  version1  upgraded  zip801  zip804\n      18        0 Male          12        2    109.5     5           0         0         0       0       0\n       1        0 Male           1        1     22.0    17           0         0         0       0       0\n       3        0 Male          17        1     20.0    17           0         0         1       0       0\n      11        1 Male          17        1     24.5     4           0         1         0       0       0\n       5        0 Male           9        3     73.5    10           0         0         0       0       0\n\nEstimation data      :\n bizflag  sincepurch   numords   dollars      last  owntaxprod  version1  upgraded  zip801  zip804  zip_bins_2  zip_bins_3  zip_bins_4  zip_bins_5  zip_bins_6  zip_bins_7  zip_bins_8  zip_bins_9  zip_bins_10  zip_bins_11  zip_bins_12  zip_bins_13  zip_bins_14  zip_bins_15  zip_bins_16  zip_bins_17  zip_bins_18  zip_bins_19  zip_bins_20  sex_Male  sex_Unknown\n       0   -0.360809 -0.057079  0.207902 -1.137183           0         0         0       0       0       False       False       False       False       False       False       False       False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False         True        False        False      True        False\n       0   -1.458194 -0.863720 -0.873735  0.119783           0         0         0       0       0       False       False       False       False       False       False       False       False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False      True        False\n       0    0.138003 -0.863720 -0.898458  0.119783           0         0         1       0       0       False        True       False       False       False       False       False       False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False      True        False\n       1    0.138003 -0.863720 -0.842831 -1.241930           0         1         0       0       0       False       False       False       False       False       False       False       False        False         True        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False      True        False\n       0   -0.660096  0.749561 -0.237115 -0.613447           0         0         0       0       0       False       False       False        True       False       False       False       False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False      True        False\n\n\n\nclf2.plot(\"vimp\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the second neural network model, which now includes two hidden layers with one node each, the permutation importance plot indicates a shift in feature influence. Zip_bins retains its position as the most impactful feature, but upgraded has risen in importance, surpassing last, which was more significant in the first model. This suggests that the model is now giving more weight to the upgrade status of a customer when predicting the outcome. Features like numords and version1 also contribute to the model‚Äôs predictions, but to a lesser extent, while dollars and owntaxprod remain less influential.\n\nclf2.plot(\"pred\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nintuit75k['pred_nn2'] = clf2.predict(intuit75k)['prediction']\n\n\ndct = {\"train\": intuit75k[intuit75k.training == 1], \"test\": intuit75k[intuit75k.training == 0]}\nfig = rsm.gains_plot(dct, \"res1\", \"Yes\", \"pred_nn2\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe partial dependence plots offer a more detailed look into the relationships between each feature and the model‚Äôs predictions. The zip_bins plot continues to show that lower bin values are associated with a higher probability of a positive response, reinforcing its top importance. The upgraded feature shows an upward trend, which aligns with its increased importance, suggesting that customers who have upgraded are more likely to have a positive response. Other features, such as numords, last, version1, and owntaxprod, show relatively flat trends, indicating a less significant effect on the prediction. These plots further confirm the model‚Äôs reliance on geographical segmentation and upgrade status, while time since last activity has become relatively less important compared to the first model.\nAs indicated by the prediction plots above, we see that by adding more hidden layers, our neural network become more flexible. However, the flexibility of the model can still be increased, and we will want to consider building an even more flexible model.\n\n\nNN with 1 hidden layer and 3 nodes\n\nclf3a = rsm.model.mlp(\n    data= {'wave1':intuit75k.query('training == 1')},\n    rvar=\"res1_yes\",\n    evar=[\n        'zip_bins',\n        'bizflag',\n        'sex',\n        'sincepurch',\n        'numords',\n        'dollars',\n        'last',\n        'owntaxprod',\n        'version1',\n        'upgraded',\n        'zip801',\n        'zip804'\n    ],\n    hidden_layer_sizes=(3,),\n    mod_type=\"classification\",\n)\nclf3a.summary()\n\nMulti-layer Perceptron (NN)\nData                 : wave1\nResponse variable    : res1_yes\nLevel                : None\nExplanatory variables: zip_bins, bizflag, sex, sincepurch, numords, dollars, last, owntaxprod, version1, upgraded, zip801, zip804\nModel type           : classification\nNr. of features      : (12, 31)\nNr. of observations  : 52,500\nHidden_layer_sizes   : (3,)\nActivation function  : tanh\nSolver               : lbfgs\nAlpha                : 0.0001\nBatch size           : auto\nLearning rate        : 0.001\nMaximum iterations   : 10000\nrandom_state         : 1234\nAUC                  : 0.778\n\nRaw data             :\nzip_bins  bizflag  sex  sincepurch  numords  dollars  last  owntaxprod  version1  upgraded  zip801  zip804\n      18        0 Male          12        2    109.5     5           0         0         0       0       0\n       1        0 Male           1        1     22.0    17           0         0         0       0       0\n       3        0 Male          17        1     20.0    17           0         0         1       0       0\n      11        1 Male          17        1     24.5     4           0         1         0       0       0\n       5        0 Male           9        3     73.5    10           0         0         0       0       0\n\nEstimation data      :\n bizflag  sincepurch   numords   dollars      last  owntaxprod  version1  upgraded  zip801  zip804  zip_bins_2  zip_bins_3  zip_bins_4  zip_bins_5  zip_bins_6  zip_bins_7  zip_bins_8  zip_bins_9  zip_bins_10  zip_bins_11  zip_bins_12  zip_bins_13  zip_bins_14  zip_bins_15  zip_bins_16  zip_bins_17  zip_bins_18  zip_bins_19  zip_bins_20  sex_Male  sex_Unknown\n       0   -0.360809 -0.057079  0.207902 -1.137183           0         0         0       0       0       False       False       False       False       False       False       False       False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False         True        False        False      True        False\n       0   -1.458194 -0.863720 -0.873735  0.119783           0         0         0       0       0       False       False       False       False       False       False       False       False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False      True        False\n       0    0.138003 -0.863720 -0.898458  0.119783           0         0         1       0       0       False        True       False       False       False       False       False       False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False      True        False\n       1    0.138003 -0.863720 -0.842831 -1.241930           0         1         0       0       0       False       False       False       False       False       False       False       False        False         True        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False      True        False\n       0   -0.660096  0.749561 -0.237115 -0.613447           0         0         0       0       0       False       False       False        True       False       False       False       False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False      True        False\n\n\n\nclf3a.plot('vimp')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the third model, which is a neural network with one hidden layer and three nodes, the permutation importance plot shows a slight rearrangement in feature importance. Zip_bins continues to be the leading factor, suggesting that geographic segmentation remains a key predictor in the model. The feature upgraded retains substantial importance, affirming its strong predictive power regarding the response variable. Interestingly, version1 has increased in importance compared to the previous models, hinting that the specific version of a product or service is becoming more relevant in the model‚Äôs predictions. Last and numords follow in importance, indicating they are useful but less decisive in influencing the model‚Äôs outcome.\n\nclf3a.plot('pred')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe partial dependence plots reveal the following insights:\n\nZip_bins shows a sharp decline, indicating a strong relationship between lower bin values and the likelihood of a positive response.\nThe effect of numords is relatively flat, suggesting a limited influence on the predicted outcome.\nThe last feature shows a downward trend, implying that more recent interactions might correspond to a lower probability of a positive outcome, which is consistent with its position in the permutation importance plot.\nThe upgraded plot has an upward trend, reinforcing its role as an influential predictor, as higher values correlate with a greater likelihood of a positive outcome.\n\nThe consistency of zip_bins and upgraded across all models as top predictors underlines their significance in determining the response variable. The rise of version1 in importance could indicate that the model is beginning to capture more nuanced patterns as the complexity of the network increases. However, features like dollars and owntaxprod remain less impactful, suggesting that they might not be as crucial for the model‚Äôs decision-making process or that their effects are possibly being captured indirectly through interactions with other features.\n\nintuit75k['pred_nn3a'] = clf3a.predict(intuit75k)['prediction']\n\n\n\nNN with 2 nodes and 10 hidden layers\n\nclf10 = rsm.model.mlp(\n    data = {'wave1':intuit75k.query('training == 1')},\n    rvar = 'res1_yes',\n    evar = [\n        'zip_bins',\n        'sex',\n        'numords',\n        'bizflag',\n        'dollars',\n        'last',\n        'owntaxprod',\n        'sincepurch',\n        'version1',\n        'upgraded',\n        'zip801',\n        'zip804'\n    ],\n    hidden_layer_sizes = (10,10),\n    mod_type = 'classification'\n)\nclf10.summary()\n\nMulti-layer Perceptron (NN)\nData                 : wave1\nResponse variable    : res1_yes\nLevel                : None\nExplanatory variables: zip_bins, sex, numords, bizflag, dollars, last, owntaxprod, sincepurch, version1, upgraded, zip801, zip804\nModel type           : classification\nNr. of features      : (12, 31)\nNr. of observations  : 52,500\nHidden_layer_sizes   : (10, 10)\nActivation function  : tanh\nSolver               : lbfgs\nAlpha                : 0.0001\nBatch size           : auto\nLearning rate        : 0.001\nMaximum iterations   : 10000\nrandom_state         : 1234\nAUC                  : 0.838\n\nRaw data             :\nzip_bins  sex  numords  bizflag  dollars  last  owntaxprod  sincepurch  version1  upgraded  zip801  zip804\n      18 Male        2        0    109.5     5           0          12         0         0       0       0\n       1 Male        1        0     22.0    17           0           1         0         0       0       0\n       3 Male        1        0     20.0    17           0          17         0         1       0       0\n      11 Male        1        1     24.5     4           0          17         1         0       0       0\n       5 Male        3        0     73.5    10           0           9         0         0       0       0\n\nEstimation data      :\n  numords  bizflag   dollars      last  owntaxprod  sincepurch  version1  upgraded  zip801  zip804  zip_bins_2  zip_bins_3  zip_bins_4  zip_bins_5  zip_bins_6  zip_bins_7  zip_bins_8  zip_bins_9  zip_bins_10  zip_bins_11  zip_bins_12  zip_bins_13  zip_bins_14  zip_bins_15  zip_bins_16  zip_bins_17  zip_bins_18  zip_bins_19  zip_bins_20  sex_Male  sex_Unknown\n-0.057079        0  0.207902 -1.137183           0   -0.360809         0         0       0       0       False       False       False       False       False       False       False       False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False         True        False        False      True        False\n-0.863720        0 -0.873735  0.119783           0   -1.458194         0         0       0       0       False       False       False       False       False       False       False       False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False      True        False\n-0.863720        0 -0.898458  0.119783           0    0.138003         0         1       0       0       False        True       False       False       False       False       False       False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False      True        False\n-0.863720        1 -0.842831 -1.241930           0    0.138003         1         0       0       0       False       False       False       False       False       False       False       False        False         True        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False      True        False\n 0.749561        0 -0.237115 -0.613447           0   -0.660096         0         0       0       0       False       False       False        True       False       False       False       False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False        False      True        False\n\n\n\nclf10.plot('vimp')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclf10.plot('pred')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nintuit75k['pred_nn10'] = clf10.predict(intuit75k)['prediction']\n\n\ndct = {\"train\": intuit75k[intuit75k.training == 1], \"test\": intuit75k[intuit75k.training == 0]}\nfig = rsm.gains_plot(dct, \"res1\", \"Yes\", \"pred_nn10\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the latest neural network model with two nodes in each of ten hidden layers, the summary and permutation importance plot provide insights into its learning process. This more complex model architecture did not converge, which suggests that the optimization algorithm (likely L-BFGS) was unable to find a solution that minimally satisfies the problem constraints within the iteration limit. This might be due to an insufficient number of iterations, a need for better scaling of input data, or an overly complex model for the given data.\nThe permutation importance plot for this non-converged model indicates that zip_bins remains the most critical feature, followed by upgraded and last, which is consistent with previous models. This underscores the model‚Äôs reliance on geographic data, upgrade status, and recent activity as key determinants of the predicted outcome. Other features such as numords, version1, and dollars continue to be relevant, but their impact on the model‚Äôs predictions is less pronounced.\nWithout convergence, however, the reliability of these importance scores might be compromised. It‚Äôs also important to note that without a properly converged model, any interpretation of the feature importances and relationships should be taken with caution. Adjusting the model‚Äôs parameters or preprocessing the input data could help achieve convergence and provide more reliable insights into the importance and effects of different features on the model‚Äôs predictions.\n\n\nEvaluating Neural Network Performance from Gains Chart\n\nintuit75k.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid\nzip5\nzip_bins\nsex\nbizflag\nnumords\ndollars\nlast\nsincepurch\nversion1\n...\ntraining\nres1_yes\nzip801\nzip804\npred_logit\npred_nn0\npred_nn1\npred_nn2\npred_nn3a\npred_nn10\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\n94553\n18\nMale\n0\n2\n109.5\n5\n12\n0\n...\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0.044161\n0.039253\n0.039253\n0.046232\n0.043931\n0.040564\n\n\n1\n2\n53190\n10\nUnknown\n0\n1\n69.5\n4\n3\n0\n...\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0.022178\n0.020067\n0.020067\n0.029727\n0.027086\n0.018918\n\n\n2\n3\n37091\n8\nMale\n0\n4\n93.0\n14\n29\n0\n...\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0.091385\n0.094208\n0.094208\n0.075088\n0.073340\n0.151937\n\n\n3\n4\n02125\n1\nMale\n0\n1\n22.0\n17\n1\n0\n...\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0.011381\n0.011572\n0.011572\n0.012489\n0.008148\n0.022096\n\n\n4\n5\n60201\n11\nMale\n0\n1\n24.5\n2\n3\n0\n...\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0.025147\n0.024115\n0.024115\n0.021093\n0.024610\n0.009841\n\n\n\n\n5 rows √ó 23 columns\n\n\n\n\n\nfig = rsm.gains_plot(intuit75k[intuit75k.training == 1],\n    \"res1\", \"Yes\",\n    [\"pred_logit\", \"pred_nn0\",\"pred_nn1\", \"pred_nn2\", \"pred_nn3a\", \"pred_nn10\"])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe gains chart provided compares the performance of three predictive models: a logistic regression model (pred_logit) and two neural network models (pred_nn1 and pred_nn2). The chart plots the percentage of positive outcomes (buyers) captured against the percentage of the population targeted based on the model‚Äôs predictions.\nAll models perform above the diagonal line, which represents random chance; this indicates that each model has predictive power beyond mere guessing. The chart shows that the logistic regression and the first neural network model (pred_nn1) have similar performance, capturing nearly the same percentage of buyers across the population targeted. The second neural network model (pred_nn2) appears to perform slightly better, capturing a marginally higher percentage of buyers for most of the population percentages targeted. This suggests that pred_nn2 may have a more nuanced understanding of the data, possibly due to a more complex model structure, and is able to more accurately identify potential buyers.\nHowever, the differences between the models are not drastic, which implies that the complexity added in the neural network models may not be translating into significantly better performance over the logistic regression in this case. The closeness of their performances also suggests that the relationships within the data might be captured almost as effectively by the simpler logistic regression model as by the more complex neural network models.\n\ndct = {\"train\": intuit75k[intuit75k.training == 1], \"test\": intuit75k[intuit75k.training == 0]}\nfig = rsm.gains_plot(dct, \"res1\", \"Yes\", [\"pred_logit\"])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth the training and test curves lie above the diagonal, indicating that the logistic regression model has learned to identify buyers more effectively than random chance. The closeness of the two lines suggests that the model generalizes well; it performs similarly on both the training data (seen data) and the test data (unseen data). This is indicative of a good model fit without overfitting, as overfitting would typically be revealed by a high performance on the training data but a significantly lower performance on the test data.\nThe chart shows that as you target more of the population based on the model‚Äôs predictions, you capture a higher percentage of buyers. Both lines show a relatively steady and linear increase, suggesting that the model ranks potential buyers effectively across the entire dataset. There‚Äôs no sharp increase at the beginning, which would suggest that there‚Äôs a subset of the population with a significantly higher likelihood of buying. Instead, the model‚Äôs predictions are spread out across the population, capturing buyers at a fairly uniform rate as more of the population is targeted.\n\nfig = rsm.gains_plot(dct, \"res1\", \"Yes\", \"pred_nn0\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfig = rsm.gains_plot(dct, \"res1\", \"Yes\", \"pred_nn1\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfig = rsm.gains_plot(dct, \"res1\", \"Yes\", \"pred_nn2\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis gains chart displays the performance of the second neural network model (pred_nn2) on both the training and test datasets. The chart demonstrates that the model is effective at identifying buyers, as indicated by the curves lying well above the diagonal line representing random selection.\nThe performance on the training data is very close to the performance on the test data, which suggests that the model generalizes well and is not overfitting. Overfitting would be indicated by a high performance on the training data but significantly worse performance on the test data. The fact that both curves are almost superimposed on each other indicates that the patterns the model has learned from the training data are applicable to the unseen test data.\nAdditionally, the curves are steeper at the beginning, which means that targeting a smaller percentage of the population based on the model‚Äôs predictions can capture a larger percentage of buyers. This is a desirable trait in a model used for prioritizing which segments of a population to target for marketing or intervention efforts. The model seems to rank potential buyers effectively, identifying those most likely to purchase early on as the population is targeted incrementally. This can be particularly valuable in applications where it is cost-effective to target only a subset of the entire population.\n\n\nModel Tuning\n\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV\nhls = [(1,), (2,), (3,), (3, 3), (4, 2), (5, 5)]\n\nparam_grid = {\"hidden_layer_sizes\": hls}\nscoring = {\"AUC\": \"roc_auc\"}\n\nclf_cv = GridSearchCV(\n    clf0.fitted, param_grid, scoring=scoring, cv=5, n_jobs=4, refit=\"AUC\", verbose=5\n)\nclf0.data_onehot.mean().round(3)\nclf0.data.res1_yes\nclf_cv.fit(clf0.data_onehot, clf0.data.res1_yes)\n\nFitting 5 folds for each of 6 candidates, totalling 30 fits\n\n\nGridSearchCV(cv=5,\n             estimator=MLPClassifier(activation='tanh', hidden_layer_sizes=(1,),\n                                     max_iter=10000, random_state=1234,\n                                     solver='lbfgs'),\n             n_jobs=4,\n             param_grid={'hidden_layer_sizes': [(1,), (2,), (3,), (3, 3),\n                                                (4, 2), (5, 5)]},\n             refit='AUC', scoring={'AUC': 'roc_auc'}, verbose=5)In a Jupyter environment, please rerun this cell to show the HTML representation or trust the notebook.

The performance on the training set is better than on the test set, which is typical as models tend to perform better on the data they were trained on.

For example, we created a new column called converted_yes to calculate the average conversion rate of cg gaming organic users.\n\n\nCode\ncg_organic.describe()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGameLevel\nNumGameDays\nNumGameDays4Plus\nNumInGameMessagesSent\nNumSpaceHeroBadges\nNumFriendRequestIgnored\nNumFriends\nTimesLostSpaceship\nTimesKilled\nTimesCaptain\nTimesNavigator\nNumAdsClicked\nDaysUser\ntraining\n\n\n\n\ncount\n30000.000000\n30000.000000\n30000.000000\n30000.000000\n30000.000000\n30000.000000\n30000.000000\n30000.000000\n30000.000000\n30000.000000\n30000.000000\n30000.000000\n30000.000000\n30000.000000\n\n\nmean\n6.246733\n12.241400\n1.257267\n73.777400\n0.443933\n29.589100\n47.733833\n4.435567\n0.293400\n1.583033\n1.403967\n9.494600\n2626.371933\n0.700000\n\n\nstd\n2.774055\n7.097305\n3.191210\n107.441593\n1.517762\n33.990783\n94.329939\n11.546392\n3.415129\n8.770534\n7.950200\n7.395841\n661.428007\n0.458265\n\n\nmin\n1.000000\n1.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n244.000000\n0.000000\n\n\n25%\n4.000000\n6.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n4.000000\n2162.000000\n0.000000\n\n\n50%\n7.000000\n13.000000\n0.000000\n26.000000\n0.000000\n16.000000\n5.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n8.000000\n2557.000000\n1.000000\n\n\n75%\n9.000000\n18.000000\n0.000000\n112.000000\n0.000000\n53.000000\n43.000000\n4.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n0.000000\n12.000000\n3105.000000\n1.000000\n\n\nmax\n10.000000\n28.000000\n24.000000\n1227.000000\n12.000000\n121.000000\n486.000000\n298.000000\n178.000000\n429.000000\n545.000000\n38.000000\n4139.000000\n1.000000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Non-numeric columns\nnon_numeric_columns = cg_organic.select_dtypes(include=['object', 'category']).columns\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Find the number of Distinct values in each column\ncg_organic[non_numeric_columns].nunique()\n\n\nconverted                 2\nAcquiredSpaceship         2\nAcquiredIonWeapon         2\nPurchasedCoinPackSmall    2\nPurchasedCoinPackLarge    2\nUserConsole               2\nUserHasOldOS              2\nconverted_yes             2\ndtype: int64\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Find the most common levels in each column\ncg_organic[non_numeric_columns].apply(lambda x: x.value_counts().idxmax())\n\n\nconverted                  no\nAcquiredSpaceship          no\nAcquiredIonWeapon          no\nPurchasedCoinPackSmall     no\nPurchasedCoinPackLarge     no\nUserConsole               yes\nUserHasOldOS               no\nconverted_yes               0\ndtype: object\n\n\n\n\nGenerate histograms for all numeric variables and frequency plots for non numeric variables\n\n\nCode\ncg_organic.hist(figsize=(15, 15))\n\n\narray([[&lt;Axes: title={'center': 'GameLevel'}&gt;,\n        &lt;Axes: title={'center': 'NumGameDays'}&gt;,\n        &lt;Axes: title={'center': 'NumGameDays4Plus'}&gt;,\n        &lt;Axes: title={'center': 'NumInGameMessagesSent'}&gt;],\n       [&lt;Axes: title={'center': 'NumSpaceHeroBadges'}&gt;,\n        &lt;Axes: title={'center': 'NumFriendRequestIgnored'}&gt;,\n        &lt;Axes: title={'center': 'NumFriends'}&gt;,\n        &lt;Axes: title={'center': 'TimesLostSpaceship'}&gt;],\n       [&lt;Axes: title={'center': 'TimesKilled'}&gt;,\n        &lt;Axes: title={'center': 'TimesCaptain'}&gt;,\n        &lt;Axes: title={'center': 'TimesNavigator'}&gt;,\n        &lt;Axes: title={'center': 'NumAdsClicked'}&gt;],\n       [&lt;Axes: title={'center': 'DaysUser'}&gt;,\n        &lt;Axes: title={'center': 'training'}&gt;, &lt;Axes: &gt;, &lt;Axes: &gt;]],\n      dtype=object)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe histograms above show the distribution of each variable present in our dataset. This is a critical step within the data preprocessing part of building a model. We can use the distributions to identify skew in our variables, and transform the variables so they are normally distributed.\nFrom the histogram above, we see many variables in this dataset are heavily skewed to the left. DaysUser and GameLevel are the only variables with a slight right skew. Because of the skews in the variables, this will give us an inaccurate model if we were to use the variables with their current distributions. Therefore, we need to transform the variables based on the skew they are exhibiting in the histograms. To correct the heavy left skew that is present in DaysUser and GameLevel, Before we begin building any models, we will want to transform these variables.\nBecause of the heavy skew present in the columns in the data, we will want to transform them to normalize their distribution. Logistic regression does not assume a normal distribution of the independent variables, however, transformations can still help in stabilizing the variance and making relationships more linear. Therefore, we will want to consider transforming the variables to create a more linear relationship.\n\nPlotting the frequency of the non-numeric variables\n\n\nCode\nfor var in non_numeric_columns:\n    cg_organic[var].value_counts().plot(kind='bar', figsize=(5, 5))\n    plt.title(f'Frequency plot of {var}')\n    plt.show()"

Permutation importance is a measure of the importance of an individual predictor variable to the performance of a model. It‚Äôs calculated by observing how random reordering (or permuting) of the feature‚Äôs values affects the model performance; the idea is that a more important feature will have a more significant effect on model performance when its values are permuted.\nBased on the chart, here are the top 5 most important variables, listed in descending order of importance:\nNumSpaceHeroBadges NumAdsClicked NumFriendRequestsIgnored TimesLostSpaceship GameLevel\n\n\nGenerate prediction plots for each of these 5 features\n\n\nCode\nlr.plot(\"pred\", incl = [\"NumSpaceHeroBadges\", \"NumFriendRequestIgnored\", \"TimesLostSpaceship\", \"GameLevel\", \"NumFriends\"])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a new variable pred_logit\n\n\nCode\ncg_organic['pred_logit'] = lr.predict(cg_organic)['prediction']\n\n\n\n\nPlot gains curves for both traning and test set\n\n\nCode\ndct = {\"train\": cg_organic[cg_organic['training'] == 1], \"test\": cg_organic[cg_organic['training'] == 0]}\nfig = rsm.gains_plot(dct, \"converted\", \"yes\", \"pred_logit\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth the training and test lines follow a similar trajectory, which indicates good generalization of the model from training to unseen data. This is evident because there‚Äôs not a significant gap between the two lines, suggesting the model is not overfitting to the training data.\nThe rapid increase at the start of both curves suggests that the model is effective in identifying buyers when a small percentage of the population is targeted. As the percentage of the population targeted increases, the gain in percentage of buyers starts to plateau, indicating diminishing returns ‚Äì targeting additional individuals beyond a certain point yields fewer new buyers.\nIn summary, this gain chart shows a model that performs well on both the training and test sets, with good generalization and effective identification of individuals who are likely buyers, particularly within certain segments of the population\n\n\nReport AUC-ROC score of the model\n\n\nCode\nfrom sklearn import metrics\n\n# prediction on training set\npred = cg_organic[cg_organic['training'] == 1]['pred_logit']\nactual = cg_organic[cg_organic['training'] == 1]['converted_yes']\nfpr, tpr, thresholds = metrics.roc_curve(actual, pred)\nmetrics.auc(fpr, tpr).round(3)\n\n\n0.82\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# prediction on test set\npred = cg_organic[cg_organic['training'] == 0]['pred_logit']\nactual = cg_organic[cg_organic['training'] == 0]['converted_yes']\nfpr, tpr, thresholds = metrics.roc_curve(actual, pred)\nmetrics.auc(fpr, tpr).round(3)\n\n\n0.803\n\n\nWe can conclude that:\nThe AUC for the training set is 0.838, which indicates that the model has a very good ability to distinguish between the two classes (buyers vs.¬†non-buyers, for example) in the training data.\nThe AUC for the test set is 0.822, which is slightly lower but still indicates a very good predictive performance on unseen data.\nThe fact that the test AUC is close to the training AUC suggests that the model is generalizing well and not overfitting significantly to the training data. A small decrease from training to test set performance is normal because models will usually perform slightly better on the data they were trained on."

Specifically, the AUC of 0.809 in part 2 significantly outperforms the AUC of 0.592 in part 3. This discrepancy highlights the value of employing a predictive model to forecast the likelihood of customers engaging with the Zalon campaign. The higher AUC in part 2 suggests that the model effectively discriminates between those who are likely to purchase and those who are not, based on the features provided to it. This is in contrast to part 3, where the absence of a predictive model results in a much lower AUC, indicating a reduced ability to identify potential purchasers effectively.\nMoreover, the comparison of gains curves between the two parts further emphasizes the advantage of utilizing a predictive model. The gains curve in part 2, being higher, indicates that the model not only predicts the probability of purchasing but does so with a degree of accuracy that significantly surpasses random guessing or the use of simplistic heuristic approaches, as implicitly employed in part 3. This visual representation corroborates the numerical evidence provided by the AUC, underscoring the model‚Äôs capability to prioritize customers more likely to respond positively to the campaign.\nOne of the advantages of selling an in-app purchase was that Creative Gaming had detailed data on how players play the game. CG would have already collected data on the control group because of the availablity of data for Apple iOS users. The reason CG would have collected data for group 1 (cg_organic_control) given that they already had data on organic conversions from the cg_organic data is to compare the organic conversion rates with the conversion rates of the other groups. This comparison would help CG to isolate the effect of the treatment (the in-app ad), in order to better understand the effectiveness of the in-app ad campaign."

The pseudo R-squared values indicate a decent fit for a logistic regression model. Finally, predictions from the retrained model (lr2) are to be made for all 150,000 customers, and these predictions are to be stored in a variable named pred_logit_ad. The logistic regression model is to be labeled lr_ad following the retraining. The overall findings suggest that the in-app ad campaign had a differential impact on various segments of players, and the retrained model can be used to predict the likelihood of conversion for the broader customer base based on their engagement patterns with the game.\n\n\nCompare the performance of original organic model and new ad model\n\n\nCode\nfig = rsm.gains_plot(\n    cg_ad_treatment[cg_ad_treatment['rnd_30k'] == 0],\n    \"converted\", \"yes\",\n    [\"pred_logit\", \"pred_logit_ad\"]\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe graph shows the performance comparison between the original model (‚Äòorganic‚Äô) and the new model (‚Äòad‚Äô) using the Area Under the Curve (AUC) metric and gains curves. The gains curves in the first image compare the percentage of buyers against the percentage of the population targeted by each model. The line representing the ‚Äòad‚Äô model (‚Äòpred_logit_ad‚Äô) consistently lies above the ‚Äòorganic‚Äô model (‚Äòpred_logit‚Äô), suggesting that the ‚Äòad‚Äô model predicts conversions more effectively across the entire range of the targeted population.\n\n\nCode\n#AUC for organic model across the 120k customers that are not in group 2\npred = cg_ad_treatment[cg_ad_treatment['rnd_30k'] == 0]['pred_logit']\nactual = cg_ad_treatment[cg_ad_treatment['rnd_30k'] == 0]['converted_yes']\nfpr, tpr, thresholds = metrics.roc_curve(actual, pred)\nprint(metrics.auc(fpr, tpr).round(3))\n\nactual = cg_ad_treatment[cg_ad_treatment['rnd_30k'] == 0]['converted']\nprint(rsm.auc(actual, pred, 'yes').round(3))\n\n\n0.644\n0.644\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# AUC for new ad model across the 120k customers that are not in group 2\npred = cg_ad_treatment[cg_ad_treatment['rnd_30k'] == 0]['pred_logit_ad']\nactual = cg_ad_treatment[cg_ad_treatment['rnd_30k'] == 0]['converted_yes']\nfpr, tpr, thresholds = metrics.roc_curve(actual, pred)\nprint(metrics.auc(fpr, tpr).round(3))\n\nactual = cg_ad_treatment[cg_ad_treatment['rnd_30k'] == 0]['converted']\nprint(rsm.auc(actual, pred, 'yes').round(3))\n\n\n0.703\n0.703\n\n\nThe ‚Äòorganic‚Äô model has an AUC of 0.592, indicating a fair but not strong discriminatory ability. In contrast, the ‚Äòad‚Äô model achieves a higher AUC of 0.703, suggesting that it has a better ability to distinguish between converters and non-converters among the customers. This improvement in AUC by the ‚Äòad‚Äô model supports the premise that incorporating in-app ad data into the model training process can enhance its predictive performance, particularly for identifying potential customers who respond to in-app advertisements.\n\n\nCalculate the profit improvement of using ad model instead of the organic\n\n\nCode\nmargin = 14.99\ncost = 1.5\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Converting using the ad model to target the best 30000 customers in the cg_ad_treatment dataset that not in 'rnd_30k == 1'\nad_best30000 = cg_ad_treatment[cg_ad_treatment['rnd_30k'] == 0].nlargest(30000, 'pred_logit_ad')\nads_response_rate, ads_profit = profit_calc(ad_best30000)\nads_response_rate, ads_profit\n\n\n/var/folders/28/cfl1_cfs3bb536qkz8wkys_w0000gn/T/ipykernel_5776/2151466375.py:2: FutureWarning:\n\nSeries.__getitem__ treating keys as positions is deprecated.

The calculation is based on targeting the best 30,000 customers from the cg_ad_treatment data not in the random 30k group. The code computes the expected profit for the top-scoring customers according to each model‚Äôs predictions, using a defined margin and cost to determine the break-even point.\nThe profit from the ‚Äúorganic‚Äù model is calculated and then compared to the profit from the ‚Äúad‚Äù model. The results show that the ‚Äúad‚Äù model yields a higher profit. Specifically, the ‚Äúorganic‚Äù model achieves a profit of approximately $51,715 with a ~22% response rate, whereas the ‚Äúad‚Äù model yields about $78,173 with a ~27% response rate, resulting in a profit improvement of around $26,457 and response rate improvement of ~51.16% when using the ‚Äúad‚Äù model.\nIn summary, the ‚Äúad‚Äù model, which incorporates the in-app ad data, significantly outperforms the ‚Äúorganic‚Äù model in terms of profit when targeting the same top 30,000 customers outside of the initial random 30k group. This suggests that the ‚Äúad‚Äù model is more effective at identifying customers who are likely to convert, leading to a more profitable targeting strategy.\n\n\nCompare the permutation importance plot of the organic and the ad model\n\n\nCode\n# Permutation importance plot of the organic model\nlr.plot('vimp')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Permutation importance plot of the ad model\nlr2.plot('vimp')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe permutation importance plots for both the ‚Äúorganic‚Äù and the ‚Äúad‚Äù models reveal differences in the relative importance of features when predicting customer conversion. In the ‚Äúorganic‚Äù model, the most important features seem to be NumSpaceHeroBadges, NumFriendRequestsIgnored, and TimesLostSpaceship, whereas in the ‚Äúad‚Äù model, NumAdsClicked appears to be the most significant feature, followed by NumFriends and GameLevel.\nThe discrepancy in feature importance between the two models can be attributed to the different nature of the datasets they were trained on. The ‚Äúorganic‚Äù model likely did not have access to data on customer interactions with in-app ads, which explains why gameplay-related features such as badges and friends are more predictive in this model. On the other hand, the ‚Äúad‚Äù model includes data from the in-app ad campaign, making NumAdsClicked a crucial predictor, as it directly relates to the customer‚Äôs engagement with the ad content that is hypothesized to influence conversion.\nFurthermore, the change in the ranking of features such as GameLevel and NumFriends between the two models suggests that the context in which these features affect conversion may have shifted when ad engagement data is included. It‚Äôs possible that the behavior patterns associated with clicking ads are more indicative of conversion likelihood than organic game engagement metrics when ad data is present. This underscores the potential impact of in-app advertising on user behavior and the importance of incorporating such data into predictive modeling for more accurate targeting and conversion forecasts."

percentage of the total response compared to the logistic regression model.\nIn the neural network model, we use Grid Search to tune the hyperparameters, i.e.¬†the hidden layer size and the learning rate. These two hyperparameters can influence the outcome:\n\nHidden layer size: By finding the right balance through grid search, we can avoid overfitting or underfitting the model, leading to a model that generalizes well to new data.\nLearning rate: the learning rate controls how much the model‚Äôs weights are updated during training. Tuning the learning rate to a level that allows for efficient and effective learning is critical for good performance.\n\nThe combination of these two hyperparameters enables the neural network to capture the complexity of the data without overfitting, leading to better generalization and ultimately better performance on the gain chart.\n\n\nCode\n# prediction on rnd_30k == 0 for neutral network \"ad\" model\npred = cg_ad_treatment[cg_ad_treatment['rnd_30k'] == 0][\"pred_nn\"]\nactual = cg_ad_treatment[cg_ad_treatment['rnd_30k'] == 0][\"converted_yes\"]\nfpr, tpr, thresholds = metrics.roc_curve(actual, pred)\nmetrics.auc(fpr, tpr).round(3)\n\n\n0.782\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# again, predict on rnd_30k == 0 for logistic regression \"ad\" model\npred = cg_ad_treatment[cg_ad_treatment['rnd_30k'] == 0][\"pred_logit_ad\"]\nactual = cg_ad_treatment[cg_ad_treatment['rnd_30k'] == 0][\"converted_yes\"]\nfpr, tpr, thresholds = metrics.roc_curve(actual, pred)\nmetrics.auc(fpr, tpr).round(3)\n\n\n0.703\n\n\nThe AUC of the neural network model is 0.782 while the AUC of the logistic regression model is 0.703. Both models have good performance, but the difference in AUC shows that the neural netwrork model has a significant better performance in term of overall measure of accuracy across all thresholds. This confirms the visual interpretation from the gain chart, where the neural network model outperforms the logistic regression model.\n\n\nCalculate the profit improvement of the neutral network ad\n\n\nCode\nnn_group3 = cg_ad_treatment[cg_ad_treatment['rnd_30k'] == 0].nlargest(30000, 'pred_nn')\nnn_response_rate, nn_profit = profit_calc(nn_group3)\n\n\n/var/folders/28/cfl1_cfs3bb536qkz8wkys_w0000gn/T/ipykernel_5776/2151466375.py:2: FutureWarning:\n\nSeries.__getitem__ treating keys as positions is deprecated.

higher percentage of the total response compared to the logistic regression model. This suggest that the random forest model is better at capturing the response in the early stages of targeting.\nAs more the population is targeted, both models‚Äô curves flatten out, which is expected as the company each out to less likely buyers, the gain from each additional percentage of the population targeted decreases. However, the random forest model, which has been fine-tuned using grid search on hyperparameters like max features and number of estimators, appears to outperform the logistic regression model at all levels of the population targeted.\nThe reason why the random forest perform better:\n\nNon-linearity: Random forest can capture complex, non-linear relationships between the features and the target variable, which logistic regression may not able to model as effectively.\nInteraction effects: Random forest naturally account for interaction between features without needing explicit feature engineering.\nHyperparameter tuning: The Grid Search process likely helped i finding an optimal combination of hyperparameters for the Random Forest model, enhancing its ability to generalize.\n\n\n\nCode\n# prediction on rnd_30k == 0 for neutral network \"ad\" model\npred = cg_ad_treatment[cg_ad_treatment['rnd_30k'] == 0][\"pred_rf\"]\nactual = cg_ad_treatment[cg_ad_treatment['rnd_30k'] == 0][\"converted_yes\"]\nfpr, tpr, thresholds = metrics.roc_curve(actual, pred)\nmetrics.auc(fpr, tpr).round(3)\n\n\n0.781\n\n\nThe Random Forest model has AUC of 0.78, indicating that it has a good performance, with 78% chance of correctly distinguishing between a converting and non-converting customer. This is higher than the AUC of the logistic regression model, which is 0.703. This confirms the visual interpretation from the gain chart, where the random forest model outperforms the logistic regression model.\nThis means that the Random Forest model would likely lead to a better identification of positive cases, which could be more efficient and potentially more profitable.\n\n\n\nCalculate the profit improvement of the random forest model\n\n\nCode\nrf_group3 = cg_ad_treatment[cg_ad_treatment['rnd_30k'] == 0].nlargest(30000, 'pred_rf')\nrf_response_rate, rf_profit = profit_calc(rf_group3)\n\n\n/var/folders/28/cfl1_cfs3bb536qkz8wkys_w0000gn/T/ipykernel_5776/2151466375.py:2: FutureWarning:\n\nSeries.__getitem__ treating keys as positions is deprecated. In a future version, integer keys will always be treated as labels (consistent with DataFrame behavior). To access a value by position, use `ser.iloc[pos]`\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nmod_pef = pd.DataFrame({\n    \"model\": [\"Random Forest\", \"Ads\"],\n    \"Response Rate\": [rf_response_rate, ads_response_rate],\n    \"Profit\": [rf_profit, ads_profit]\n})\nmod_pef\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmodel\nResponse Rate\nProfit\n\n\n\n\n0\nRandom Forest\n0.3119\n95261.43\n\n\n1\nAds\n0.2739\n78172.83\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nprofit_improvement = rf_profit - ads_profit\nprofit_improvement\n\n\n17088.60000000002\n\n\nBased on the calculation above, the profit improvement from using Random Forest model over the logistic regression model ad is 15,949.36, this represents a 12% improvement in profit when using Random Forest model over the logistic regression model ad.\nThis aligns with the gain chart and AUC, which both show that the Random Forest model outperforms the logistic regression model in terms of capturing the response and overall accuracy."

This measures spending across all departments, not just the department that sent the message\n\n\nNote: In addition to the six message groups, a seventh group of customers received no promotional e-mails for the duration of the test (‚Äúcontrol‚Äù).\n\n\npentathlon_nptb.info()\n\n&lt;class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'&gt;\nRangeIndex: 600000 entries, 0 to 599999\nData columns (total 16 columns):\n #   Column            Non-Null Count   Dtype   \n---  ------            --------------   -----   \n 0   custid            600000 non-null  object  \n 1   buyer             600000 non-null  category\n 2   total_os          600000 non-null  int32   \n 3   message           600000 non-null  category\n 4   age               600000 non-null  category\n 5   female            600000 non-null  category\n 6   income            600000 non-null  int32   \n 7   education         600000 non-null  int32   \n 8   children          600000 non-null  float64 \n 9   freq_endurance    600000 non-null  int32   \n 10  freq_strength     600000 non-null  int32   \n 11  freq_water        600000 non-null  int32   \n 12  freq_team         600000 non-null  int32   \n 13  freq_backcountry  600000 non-null  int32   \n 14  freq_racquet      600000 non-null  int32   \n 15  training          600000 non-null  float64 \ndtypes: category(4), float64(2), int32(9), object(1)\nmemory usage: 36.6+ MB\n\n\n\npentathlon_nptb['buyer_yes'] = rsm.ifelse(pentathlon_nptb['buyer'] == 'yes', 1, 0)\npentathlon_nptb['buyer_yes'].value_counts()\n\nbuyer_yes\n0    585600\n1     14400\nName: count, dtype: int64\n\n\n\nCheck the training data and testing data, make sure they are splitted a 70-30 ratio\n\npd.crosstab(pentathlon_nptb[\"message\"], pentathlon_nptb[\"training\"])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntraining\n0.0\n1.0\n\n\nmessage\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbackcountry\n26179\n60425\n\n\ncontrol\n26043\n61217\n\n\nendurance\n24773\n58083\n\n\nracquet\n26316\n60772\n\n\nstrength\n25251\n59029\n\n\nteam\n25942\n60850\n\n\nwater\n25496\n59624\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npentathlon_nptb.training.value_counts(normalize=True)\n\ntraining\n1.0    0.7\n0.0    0.3\nName: proportion, dtype: float64\n\n\n\npentathlon_nptb.hist(figsize=(10, 10), bins=30)\n\narray([[&lt;Axes: title={'center': 'total_os'}&gt;,\n        &lt;Axes: title={'center': 'income'}&gt;,\n        &lt;Axes: title={'center': 'education'}&gt;],\n       [&lt;Axes: title={'center': 'children'}&gt;,\n        &lt;Axes: title={'center': 'freq_endurance'}&gt;,\n        &lt;Axes: title={'center': 'freq_strength'}&gt;],\n       [&lt;Axes: title={'center': 'freq_water'}&gt;,\n        &lt;Axes: title={'center': 'freq_team'}&gt;,\n        &lt;Axes: title={'center': 'freq_backcountry'}&gt;],\n       [&lt;Axes: title={'center': 'freq_racquet'}&gt;,\n        &lt;Axes: title={'center': 'training'}&gt;,\n        &lt;Axes: title={'center': 'buyer_yes'}&gt;]], dtype=object)"

A small decrease from training to test set performance is normal because models will usually perform slightly better on the data they were trained on.\n\n\n1.

After relizing that the model predicts that every customer should be sent the same product i.e, endurance, we build another model that can capture these interaction effects.\nWe then extend the prediction to the full database. To predict the probability of purchasing for different messages, we use the data_cmd to predict the probability of purchasing for different messages.\nFinally, we choose the product with the highest probability using idxmax to automatically find the best message for each customer. This command also provides a label for the category with the maximum predicted propability of buying accross all the products. Then, create p_max to store the maximum predicted probability of purchasing for the best message sellected for each customer.\n\n\n2. For each message, report the percentage of customers for whom that message or no-message maximizes their probability of purchase\nLet‚Äôs create a crosstab to see which products should we send to each customer.\n\npd.crosstab(index=pentathlon_nptb[pentathlon_nptb.training == 0].messagei_lr, columns=\"count\").apply(rsm.format_nr)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncol_0\ncount\n\n\nmessagei_lr\n\n\n\n\n\nbackcountry\n1,447\n\n\nendurance\n125,861\n\n\nracquet\n12,299\n\n\nstrength\n36,584\n\n\nteam\n1,680\n\n\nwater\n2,129\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReport the percentage of customers for whom that message is the best message or not the best message.\n\npentathlon_nptb[\"messagei_lr\"].value_counts(normalize=True)\n\nmessagei_lr\nendurance      0.699675\nstrength       0.202202\nracquet        0.069037\nwater          0.011852\nteam           0.009358\nbackcountry    0.007875\ncontrol        0.000002\nName: proportion, dtype: float64\n\n\n\nedurance: The distribution suggests that endurance - related messages resonate significantly more with the customers than the other messages.\nstrength: Wilte not as dominant as endurance, strength - related messages also play an important role. There might be opportunities to further optimize or tailor these messages to increase their effectiveness.\nOther categories such as racquet, water, team, backcountry have much smaller proportions, suggesting that they are less often the best choice for maximizing the probability of purchase.\ncontrol: The negligible role of control in maximizing the probability suggrest that any engagement, even if not perfectly oplimized, tends to be better than no engagement at all.

We then extend the prediction to the full database and see how the predictions are distributed.\nSame as the previous model, we use the data_cmd to predict the order size for different messages.\nAfter that, we calculate the expected profit for each product by multiplying the probability of purchasing and the order size for each product. We then choose the product with the highest expected profit using idxmax to automatically find the best message for each customer. This command also provides a label for the category with the maximum expected profit. Then, create p_max to store the maximum expected profit of purchasing for the best message sellected for each customer.\n\n\n4.Report for each message, i.e., endurance, racket, etc., and no-message, the percentage of customers for whom that (no) message maximizes their expected profit.\n\npentathlon_nptb.ep_message_lr.value_counts(normalize=True)\n\nep_message_lr\nwater          0.340890\nendurance      0.306053\nteam           0.206722\nbackcountry    0.073778\nstrength       0.066898\nracquet        0.004322\ncontrol        0.001337\nName: proportion, dtype: float64\n\n\n\n\n5.

The model was trained using the training data and then used to predict the probability of purchasing for the test data. The model was then used to predict the probability of purchasing for the full database. To predict the probability of purchasing for different messages, we use the data_cmd to predict the probability of purchasing for different messages.\nFinally, we choose the product with the highest probability using idxmax to automatically find the best message for each customer. This command also provides a label for the category with the maximum predicted probability of buying across all the products. Then, p_max was created to store the maximum predicted probability of purchasing for the best message selected for each customer.\n\n2.

Above, we are training our base random forest model, and we will use this base random forest model to tune our hyperparameters, as seen below.\nSome interesting key features of the output of this random forest model is the AUC value. In our base model, we see that the AUC is a 0.818. This is a decent value for AUC, with anything over 0.5 typically being considered a good model.\n\nRandom Forest Model Tuning\n\n#max_features = [None, 'auto', 'sqrt', 'log2', 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]\n#n_estimators = [10, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000]\n\n\n#param_grid = {\"max_features\": max_features, \"n_estimators\": n_estimators}\n#scoring = {\"AUC\": \"roc_auc\"}\n\n#rf_cv = GridSearchCV(rf.fitted, param_grid, scoring=scoring, cv=5, n_jobs=2, refit=\"AUC\", verbose=5)\n\nBelow is the code for the grid search of a very large matrix. I would not recommend running this, as it takes a very long time to run. However, I have included the code for the grid search below.\nrf_cv.fit(rf.data_onehot, rf.data.buyer_yes)\n\n::: {#bdc7b1cb .cell execution_count=107}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n#rf_cv.fit(rf_treatment.data_onehot, rf_treatment.data.buyer_yes)\n:::\nAbove, we conduct a grid search to identify which hyperparameters are best for our random forest model. However, when running a gridsearch this large, we ran into a computational cost issue that caused either our hyperparameter grid search to run for 4 hours, or caused the kernel to crash. Therefore, we conducted multiple step-wise grid searches where we limited the gridsearch matrix size, and went through the various iterations of combinations to see which parameters created the most robut model. Below, you can see the various rounds of model tuning.\n\n\nRandom Forest Model Tuning - Stepwise, limiting the grid search\n\n#max_features1 = ['sqrt']\n#n_estimators1 = [1000, 2000]\n\n\n#param_grid = {\"max_features\": max_features1, \"n_estimators\": n_estimators1}\n#scoring = {\"AUC\": \"roc_auc\"}\n\n#rf_cv_treatment1 = GridSearchCV(rf_treatment.fitted, param_grid, scoring=scoring, cv=4, n_jobs=2, refit=\"AUC\", verbose=5)\n\nBecause our random forest model took over 4 hours to run previously, we decided to limit the grid search to 9 iterations. Our goal is to create a balance between exploring the hyperparameter space and keeping the computational cost reasonable.\n\n#rf_cv_treatment1.fit(rf_treatment.data_onehot, rf_treatment.data.buyer_yes)\n\n\n#rf_cv_treatment1.best_params_\n\nAs seen above, the grid search identified that the best parameters were as follows: - max_features: ‚Äòsqrt‚Äô - n_estimators: 1000\nWhen we run our random forest model with the best parameters identified from the grid search, the AUC score is approximately 0.862.\n\nrf_tuned = rsm.model.rforest(\n    data = {'NPTB': pentathlon_nptb.query(\"training == 1\")},\n    rvar = 'buyer',\n    lev = 'yes',\n    evar = evar,\n    n_estimators = 1000,\n    max_features = 'sqrt'\n)\nrf_tuned.summary()\n\nRandom Forest\nData                 : NPTB\nResponse variable    : buyer\nLevel                : yes\nExplanatory variables: message, age, female, income, education, children, freq_endurance, freq_strength, freq_water, freq_team, freq_backcountry, freq_racquet\nOOB                  : True\nModel type           : classification\nNr. of features      : (12, 21)\nNr. of observations  : 420,000\nmax_features         : sqrt (4)\nn_estimators         : 1000\nmin_samples_leaf     : 1\nrandom_state         : 1234\nAUC                  : 0.864\n\nEstimation data      :\n income  education  children  freq_endurance  freq_strength  freq_water  freq_team  freq_backcountry  freq_racquet  message_backcountry  message_control  message_endurance  message_racquet  message_strength  message_team  message_water  age_&lt; 30  age_30 to 44  age_45 to 59  age_&gt;= 60  female_no\n  55000         19       0.8               0              4           0          4                 0             1                False            False              False            False             False          True          False     False          True         False      False       True\n  45000         33       0.7               0              0           0          0                 2             2                False            False               True            False             False         False          False     False         False          True      False      False\n  25000         24       0.2               0              0           0          0                 0             0                False            False              False            False             False         False           True     False         False          True      False      False\n  25000         18       0.3               0              0           0          0                 0             0                False            False              False            False              True         False          False      True         False         False      False      False\n  65000         36       1.2               1              1           0          2                 0             3                False            False              False            False              True         False          False     False         False         False       True      False\n\n\n\npentathlon_nptb['pred_rf'] = rf_tuned.predict(pentathlon_nptb)['prediction']\npentathlon_nptb['pred_rf'].mean()\n\n0.025235874483417724\n\n\n\ndct_rf = {\"train_rf\": pentathlon_nptb.query(\"training == 1\"), \"test_rf\": pentathlon_nptb.query(\"training == 0\")}\nfig = rsm.gains_plot(dct_rf, \"buyer\", \"yes\", \"pred_rf\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe gains chart above is a visual representation of the AUC score. The gains chart shows the percentage of the total number of cases in a given category that are captured by the model. Based on the steep rise at the beginning of the curve, indicates that the model is effective at ranking the positive events, i.e.. buyers, higher than the negative ones. The more steep the initial part of the curve, the better the model is at identifying the positive events early on when you start targeting the population based on the model‚Äôs scores.\nIn this specific chart, the model seems to perform fairly well, particularly because the initial sections of both curves are quite steep, indicating that a significant percentage of the positive events can be captured by targeting a relatively small percentage of the population.\n\nfrom sklearn import metrics\n\n\ndef apply_rand_message(data, pred_col, message_col):\n    np.random.seed(1234)\n    data[\"random_number\"] = np.random.randint(2, size = len(data))\n    data[\"random_message\"] = rsm.ifelse(data[\"random_number\"] == 1, data[message_col], \"no message\")\n    data[\"random_pred\"] = rsm.ifelse(data[\"random_number\"] == 1, data[pred_col], 0)\n    return data\n\n\n# prediction on training data\npred_rf = pentathlon_nptb.query(\"training == 1\")[\"pred_rf\"]\nactual_rf = pentathlon_nptb.query(\"training == 1\")[\"buyer_yes\"]\nfpr, tpr, thresholds = metrics.roc_curve(actual_rf, pred_rf)\nmetrics.auc(fpr, tpr).round(3)\n\n1.0\n\n\n\n# prediction on test data\npred_rf = pentathlon_nptb.query(\"training == 0\")[\"pred_rf\"]\nactual_rf = pentathlon_nptb.query(\"training == 0\")[\"buyer_yes\"]\nfpr, tpr, thresholds = metrics.roc_curve(actual_rf, pred_rf)\nmetrics.auc(fpr, tpr).round(3)\n\n0.869\n\n\nBased on the Gains Chart, and the AUC values for the test and training set, we can conclude that the model is performing decently well. Because of the perfect AUC score on the training data, there is a slight hesitation that the model may be overfitting. However, the AUC score on the test data is still quite high, indicating that the model is generalizing well.\nThe AUC for the training set is 1, which indicates that the model has a very good ability to distinguish between the two classes in the training data.

We will use buyer_yes as the response variable and the other variables as predictors.\nWe use our random forest model to extend the prediction to the full database. To predict the probability of purchasing for different messages, we use the data_cmd to predict the probability of purchasing for different messages.\nFinally, we select the product with the highest probability using idxmax. This command also provides a label for the category with the maximum predicted probability of buying across all the products. Then, create p_max to store the maximum predicted probability of purchasing an item based on the messaging sent to said customer.\n\n\n\n2.

For each customer determine the message (i.e., endurance, strength, water, team, backcountry, racquet, or no-message) predicted to lead to the highest probability of purchase.\nTo determine the message that will lead to the highest probability of purchase for each customer, we can fit the model using only the data for each categorical level in our model and use the fitted model to create predictions for all of the data.

For each message, The percentage of customers for whom that message or no-message maximizes their probability of purchase:\nWe can see from the plot that endurance messages most often maximizes the cusomer‚Äôs probability of purchase. After enducance, strength messages are the second most reported value that maximizes purchase probabilities. Surprisingly, despite team, raquet, and water being the next best message groups, none of the remaining messages seem to provide a meaningful improvement over sending no message at all.\n\nmessage_percentages= pentathlon_nptb['message_xgb'].value_counts(normalize=True)\nmessage_percentages\n\nmessage_xgb\nendurance      0.298708\nstrength       0.164657\nteam           0.119880\nracquet        0.116688\nwater          0.107015\ncontrol        0.098108\nbackcountry    0.094943\nName: proportion, dtype: float64\n\n\n\n# Plotting\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nmessage_percentages.plot(kind='bar')\nplt.ylabel('Percentage of Customers')\nplt.xlabel('Message Type')\nplt.title('Percentage of Customers for Each Message Value')\nplt.xticks(rotation=45)  # Rotate labels to make them readable\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor each customer, determine the message (i.e., endurance, strength, water, team, backcountry, racquet, or no-message) predicted to lead to the highest expected profit (COGS is 60%).\nThe message returning the highest profit is Endurance\nTo predict order size we tuned a new xgb model to the data and regressed the likely order size for each record. We then used the predicted order size to calculate the expected profit for each record. We calculated the expected profit by multiplying the predicted order size by the probability of purchase and subtracting the cost of goods sold from the result.\n\nrvar_os = \"total_os\"\nevar =

This is likely the cause of the long tunning time. The complexity grows with the size of the dataset, the number of features, and the model parameters.\nScalability: Because of the computational cost, scaling Random Forest to very large datasets or high-dimensional data can be challenging and might require significant computational resources.\nModel Interpretability: While not as complex as some other models like neural networks, Random Forests are still considered a ‚Äúblack box‚Äù compared to simpler models like Logistic Regression. This can make it difficult to understand the decision-making process of the model and to explain individual predictions.\nTuning Required: Random Forest models have several hyperparameters (like the number of trees, max depth, min samples split, etc.) that can greatly influence performance. Finding the optimal settings can be time-consuming and require a lot of trial and error or automated search techniques like grid search or random search, which can further increase the computational burden.\n\nSuggested Improvement:\n\nModel Simplification: We should simplying the model by reducing the number of trees or the depth of each tree, which might reduce training time at the cost of some accuracy.\nFeature Selection: Reducing the number of features through feature selection can significantly decrease training time and sometimes even improve model performance by eliminating noise.\nIncremental Learning: Some models allow for incremental learning, where the model is trained on chunks of the dataset sequentially, which can reduce memory consumption and potentially training time."
